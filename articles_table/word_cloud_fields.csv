A Deep Learning and Social IoT Approach for Plants Disease Prediction Toward a Sustainable Agriculture,"As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, emerging and innovative sensing technologies are shaping the future of agriculture, with a special focus on sustainability-related issues. In this context, we envision the possibility to exploit Social Internet of Things for sensing of environmental conditions (solar radiation, humidity, air temperature, and soil moisture) and communications, deep learning for plant disease detection, and crowdsourcing for images collection and classification, engaging farmers and community garden owners and experts. Through, data fusion and deep learning, the designed system can exploit the collected data and predict when a plant would (or not) get a disease, with a specific degree of precision, with the final purpose to render agriculture more sustainable. We here present the architecture, the deep learning model, and the responsive Web app. Finally, some experimental evaluations and usability/engagement tests are reported and discussed, together with final remarks, limitations, and future work.",Diseases; Internet of Things; Agriculture; Sensors; Deep learning; Smart phones; Plants (biology); Deep learning; plant disease detection; plant disease prediction; Social Internet of Things (SIoT)
Context-Aware Service Discovery: Graph Techniques for IoT Network Learning and Socially Connected Objects,"Adopting Internet-of-things (IoT) in large-scale environments such as smart cities raises compatibility and trustworthiness challenges, hindering conventional service discovery and network navigability processes. The IoT network is known for its highly dynamic topology and frequently changing characteristics (e.g., the devices' status, such as battery capacity and computational power); traditional methods fail to learn and understand the evolving behavior of the network to enable real-time and context-aware service discovery in such diverse and large-scale topologies of IoT networks. The Social IoT (SIoT) concept, which defines the relationships among the connected objects, can be exploited to extract established relationships between devices and enable trustworthy and context-aware services. In fact, SIoT expresses the possible connections that devices can establish in the network and reflect compatibility, trustworthiness, and so on. In this paper, we investigate the service discovery process in SIoT networks by proposing a low-complexity context-aware Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to enable rapid and dynamic service discovery. Unlike the conventional graph-based techniques, the proposed approach simultaneously embeds the devices' features and their SIoT relations. Our simulations on a real-world IoT dataset show that the proposed GNN-based approach can provide more concise clusters compared to traditional techniques, namely the Louvain and Leiden algorithms. This allows a better IoT network learning and understanding and also, speeds up the service lookup search space. Finally, we discuss implementing the GNN-assisted context-service discovery processes in novel smart city IoT-enabled applications.",Smart cities; Security; Graph neural networks; Semantics; STEM; Context awareness; Social Internet of Things; Community detection; service discovery; graph neural networks; social Internet of Things
Deep Learning-Embedded Social Internet of Things for Ambiguity-Aware Social Recommendations,"With the increasing demand of users for personalized social services, social recommendation (SR) has been an important concern in academia. However, current research on SR universally faces two main challenges. On the one hand, SR lacks the considerable ability of robust online data management. On the other hand, SR fails to take the ambiguity of preference feedback into consideration. To bridge these gaps, a deep learning-embedded social Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed for ambiguity-aware SR (SIoT-SR). Specifically, a social IoT architecture is developed for social computing scenarios to guarantee reliable data management. A deep learning-based graph neural network model that can be embedded into the model is proposed as the core algorithm to perform ambiguity-aware SR. This design not only provides proper online data sensing and management but also overcomes the preference ambiguity problem in SR. To evaluate the performance of the proposed SIoT-SR, two real-world datasets are selected to establish experimental scenarios. The method is assessed using three different metrics, selecting five typical methods as benchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed SIoT-SR performs better than the benchmark methods by at least 10% and has good robustness.",Data models; Computer architecture; Social networking (online); Internet of Things; Encoding; Social computing; Graph neural networks; Deep learning; graph neural networks; social IoT; social computing
Dual Preference Perception Network for Fashion Recommendation in Social Internet of Things,"Nowadays, with the continuous development of information technology, the application scenarios of the Internet of Things (IoT) are progressively expanding to the social field, engendering widespread attention to the Social IoT (SIoT). Personalized fashion recommendation that possesses the potential to establish social relationships between clothing and humans has substantially broadened the scope of the SIoT, particularly with the flourishing fashion industry and the ascent of smart home. Compared to conventional recommendations, fashion recommendation generally suggests a collection of items rather than individual pieces for users. Additionally, considering the public acceptance alongside the user-specific preference is reasonable for fashion recommendation, however, current methods often overlook the former. To comprehensively capture the public acceptance and the user-specific preference, we propose a dual preference perception network (DP2Net) for fashion recommendation. First, a fashion corpus is constructed to facilitate the condensation of general taste, wherein adversarial learning and determinantal point process are leveraged to ensure representativeness and diversity of the corpus. Second, a user-general preference perception module is built based on a bottleneck transformer structure to generate aggregated representations for the corpus. Third, a user-specific preference perception module is constructed to acquire collaborative representations of users and outfits by employing an attentive heterogeneous graph embedding. The final loss functions of two preference perception modules are constructed by combining the representations of users, outfits, and the corpus. Experiments on large-scale real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To facilitate reproducible research, we have made our code publicly available at https://github.com/KaiZhang1228/DP2Net.",Social Internet of Things; Smart homes; Task analysis; Transformers; Motion pictures; Clothing; Graph neural networks; Fashion recommendation; heterogeneous graph; preference perception; Social Internet of Things (SIoT)
EAGCN: An Efficient Adaptive Graph Convolutional Network for Item Recommendation in Social Internet of Things,"In the era of Internet of Things (IoT), intelligent recommendation is playing an important role in our daily life. How to provide personalized information to users is the core concern of Internet content service providers. To improve the recommendation quality, it is a hot topic to go beyond merely user-item interaction records and take social relations into account in IoT. Recently, emerged graph neural networks (GNNs) shine a light on simulating the recursive social diffusion process, to refine user embedding learning. Nevertheless, two key issues have not been well studied in previous studies: 1) they usually model user preference and social influence within a same semantic space and fail to simultaneously inject high-order connectivity information reflected in both user-item interaction graph and user-user social graph and 2) they typically rely on negative sampling to optimize a recommendation model, which makes them highly sensitive to the design of the sampler and hardly makes full use of GPU's computing ability. In light of this, we propose a novel framework for item recommendation, namely, an efficient adaptive graph convolutional network (EAGCN). Specifically, we introduce a space-adaptive graph convolutional module, which could jointly explore the propagation process of user interest and social influence. Furthermore, a user-specific gating mechanism is designed to aggregate user representations from both spaces. To make EAGCN practical in social IoT, we devise a fast nonsampling leaner to optimize EAGCN's parameters with better leveraging matrix computing of GPU. Extensive experiments under four scenarios show that our solution consistently and significantly outperforms strong baseline methods in both model effectiveness and training efficiency.",Internet of Things; Computational modeling; Collaboration; Adaptation models; Task analysis; Training; Social networking (online); Graph convolutional networks (GCNs); implicit feedback; nonsampling learning; recommender systems; social Internet of Things (IoT)
Effective Features to Classify Big Data Using Social Internet of Things,"Social Internet of Things (SIoT) supports many novel applications and networking services for the IoT in a more powerful and productiveway. In this paper, we have introduced a hierarchical framework for feature extraction in SIoT big data using map-reduced framework along with a supervised classifier model. Moreover, a Gabor filter is used to reduce noise and unwanted data from the database, and Hadoop Map Reduce has been used for mapping and reducing big databases, to improve the efficiency of the proposed work. Furthermore, the feature selection has been performed on a filtered data set by using Elephant Herd Optimization. The proposed system architecture has been implemented using Linear Kernel Support Vector Machine-based classifier to classify the data and for predicting the efficiency of the proposed work. From the results, the maximum accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of our work is 98.2%, 85.88%, and 80%, moreover analyzed time and memory, and these results have been compared with the existing literature.",Internet of Things; social Internet of Things; machine Learning; big data; feature selection
GazPNE2: A General Place Name Extractor for Microblogs Fusing Gazetteers and Pretrained Transformer Models,"The concept of human as sensors defines a new sensing model, in which humans act as sensors by contributing their observations, perceptions, and sensations. This is crucial for the development of Social Internet of Things, which is an integral part of cyber-physical-social systems. Online social media platforms, as the most active places where users act as social sensors, are responsive to real-world events and are useful for gathering situational information in real time. Unfortunately, posts rarely contain structured geographic information, thus hindering their usage for contributing to various challenges, such as emergency response. We address this limitation by introducing a general approach for extracting place names from tweets, named GazPNE2. It combines global gazetteers (i.e., OpenStreetMap and GeoNames), deep learning, and pretrained transformer models (i.e., BERT and BERTweet), which requires no manually annotated data. It can extract place names at both coarse (e.g., city) and fine-grained (e.g., street and POI) levels and place names with abbreviations. To fully evaluate GazPNE2 and compare it with 11 competing approaches, we use 19 public tweet data sets, containing 38 802 tweets and 22 197 places across the world. The results show GazPNE2 achieves a much higher F1 (0.8) than the other approaches. Furthermore, we apply GazPNE2 to three large unannotated tweet data sets related to over 20 crisis events (e.g., coronavirus disease 2019), containing 560 040 tweets. An F1 of 0.84 is achieved on 3000 tweets, which are randomly selected from the three data sets and then manually annotated. Code and data are available on GitHub page: https://github.com/uhuohuy/GazPNE2.",Sensors; Internet of Things; Blogs; Feature extraction; Transformers; COVID-19; Statistical learning; BERT; BERTweet; geoparsing; OpenStreetMap (OSM); place name extraction; Social Internet of Things (IoT); tweets
Intrusion Detection for Secure Social Internet of Things Based on Collaborative Edge Computing: A Generative Adversarial Network-Based Approach,"The Social Internet of Things (SIoT) now penetrates our daily lives. As a strategy to alleviate the escalation of resource congestion, collaborative edge computing (CEC) has become a new paradigm for solving the needs of the Internet of Things (IoT). CEC can provide computing, storage, and network connection resources for remote devices. Because the edge network is closer to the connected devices, it involves a large amount of users' privacy. This also makes edge networks face more and more security issues, such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, unauthorized access, packet sniffing, and man-in-the-middle attacks. To combat these issues and enhance the security of edge networks, we propose a deep learning-based intrusion detection algorithm. Based on the generative adversarial network (GAN), we designed a powerful intrusion detection method. Our intrusion detection method includes three phases. First, we use the feature selection module to process the collaborative edge network traffic. Second, a deep learning architecture based on GAN is designed for intrusion detection aiming at a single attack. Finally, we propose a new intrusion detection model by combining several intrusion detection models that aim at a single attack. Intrusion detection aiming at multiple attacks is realized through the designed GAN-based deep learning architecture. Besides, we provide a comprehensive evaluation to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.",Intrusion detection; Feature extraction; Gallium nitride; Image edge detection; Generative adversarial networks; Deep learning; Internet of Things; Collaborative edge computing (CEC); generative adversarial network (GAN); intrusion detection; social internet of things (SIoT)
MAN: Mutual Attention Neural Networks Model for Aspect-Level Sentiment Classification in SIoT,"Text sentiment classification is of critical importance to improve the autonomous decision making and communication ability among object peers in the Social Internet of Things (SIoT). To classify sentiment polarity on a fine-grained level, aspect-level sentiment classification has become a promising direction in recent years. However, the existing solutions typically ignore the mutual information between sentences and their respective aspect terms while generally performing sentiment classification by using the simple attention mechanism. Thus, the relevant results seem to be unpromising. We aim to develop a novel neural-network-based model, by relying on the natural language processing model for rich feature extraction, called mutual attention neural networks (MANs), to conduct the aspect-level sentiment classification tasks in this article. Compared with the previous work, our proposed MAN model takes advantage of the bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) networks to obtain semantic dependence of sentences and their respective aspect terms, while learning the sentiment polarities of aspect terms in sentences by proposing the mutual attention mechanism. To evaluate the performance of MAN, we conduct our experiments on three real-world data sets, i.e., LAPTOP, REST, and TWITTER. The experimental results show that our proposed MAN model has significant performance improvements when compared to several existing models, in terms of aspect-level sentiment classification.",Mutual attention mechanism; natural language processing (NLP); sentiment classification; Social Internet of Things (SIoT)
Resource Efficient Geo-Textual Hierarchical Clustering Framework for Social IoT Applications,"The Social Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm incorporates social networking concepts with the Internet of Things (IoT) solutions to support novel services. The massive amount of data (big data) produced by SIoT necessitates efficient information processing frameworks to exploit social relationships and comprehend actionable information from real-world observations. Data from AI-enabled sensors (AIS) is typically geo-tagged, thus demanding geo-textual processing for information retrieval and analysis. Social media applications are the main source of geo-textual data as mobile users connect with millions of posts daily. The processing of big geo-textual data requires resource-efficient algorithms and frameworks. Clustering algorithms are often applied to geo-textual data to examine spatial, textual, and temporal information for event detection, sentiment analysis, and search query response. Clustering algorithms on big data are resource-hungry requiring comparisons among all data points to calculate similarity and distance metrics. Existing hybrid clustering techniques execute algorithms collectively on geo-textual data resulting in a enormous footprint for big data. We propose a resource-efficient clustering framework for AIS that hierarchically performs geo-textual clustering without significantly lowering the clustering quality. The proposed framework achieves substantial time and memory efficiency while reducing the overall resource requirements for constrained end-user and edge devices compared to the standard hybrid geo-textual clustering framework. Moreover, we augment the research work by developing open-source scripts for both hierarchical and hybrid clustering frameworks.",Sensors; Artificial intelligence; Social networking (online); Big Data; Task analysis; Internet of Things; Clustering algorithms; Clustering; geo-textual; machine learning; resource efficiency; social IoT
Security Enhanced Content Sharing in Social IoT: A Directed Hypergraph-Based Learning Scheme,"Security is a critical element to the existing Internet of Things (IoT) deployment, where any user may actively or passively attack the content sharing of others reusing the same channel. As most smart devices are carried by human, we may leverage their owners' social trust to avoid being intercepted by untrusted users, which conforms to the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm. In this paper, we propose a secure content sharing (SCS) scheme to strike the trade-off between security and quality of experience (QoE) by exploring the social trust. Firstly, to dynamically extract the social trust, the random walk strategy is employed for prediction based on the proposed User-Content-Social Group graph which models users' preference over time. Given the social trust value, we propose a hierarchical game model to decouple the optimization problem into two sub-problems: user pairing and channel selection. More specifically, the user pairing sub-problem is formulated as a matching sub-game with peer effect, and the embedded rotation-swap matching algorithm can accommodate the dynamics caused by mutual interference. The second sub-problem can be formulated as a secure channel selection sub-game with the directed hypergraph being game space, which is proved to be an exact potential game. Then, we design an uncoupled-user concurrent learning algorithm (UUCL) to search for the optimal pure Nash equilibrium, and thereby the global optimum of this sub-game is achieved. Finally, simulation results generated on realistic social dataset verify that our proposed scheme can notably enhance the security without sacrificing users' QoE.",Social Internet of Things; directed hypergraph; game theory; machine learning
Self-Supervised Learning IoT Device Features With Graph Contrastive Neural Network for Device Classification in Social Internet of Things,"Device Classification (DC) is one of the critical network management means in the Internet of Things (IoT). Most machine learning-driven DC methods are implemented in two steps: firstly, extracting device features, and then training the classifier. Thus, for the same classifier, the quality of device features plays a decisive role. However, for one thing, these methods usually merely consider device traffic or device attributed features, ignoring the complex relationship between devices in Social IoT. For another thing, these features fed to the classifier are often selected manually without automatic learning. These two factors seriously affect the performance and flexibility of the algorithm. To address the above issues, we propose a novel Graph Contrastive Neural Network-based algorithm for DC dubbed GCNNDC. Specifically, based on the complex relationship between heterogeneous objects in Social IoT and the attribute information of the device itself, we first construct four kinds of homogeneous device-device attributed networks as the input of the neural network. Then, we train a novel GCNN model to learn informative device features in a self-supervised learning fashion. Finally, we leverage the features to train a classifier to complete the DC task. Experimental results on real-world IoT network dataset demonstrate the superiority of GCNNDC.",Internet of Things; Feature extraction; Task analysis; Object recognition; Classification algorithms; Telecommunication traffic; Social networking (online); Self-supervised learning; device classification; graph contrastive neural network; Social Internet of Things
Trust-Related Attacks and Their Detection: A Trust Management Model for the Social IoT,"The integration of social networking concepts into the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the so called Social Internet of Things paradigm, according to which the objects are capable of establishing social relationships in an autonomous way with respect to their owners. Within this scenario, things interact opportunistically with their peers to seek needed services. However, attacks and malfunctions in the IoT can outweigh any of its benefits if not handled adequately. In this article, we focus on the possible types of trust attacks that can affect the IoT and propose a trust management model able to overcome all the analyzed attacks. Simulations show how the proposed model can effectively isolate almost any malicious nodes in the network at the expense of an increase in the number of transactions needed for the model to converge.",Internet of Things; Quality of service; Trust management; Social networking (online); Peer-to-peer computing; Computational modeling; Social factors; Internet of Things; Social Internet of Things; trustworthiness management; machine learning
A resilient Trust Management framework towards trust related attacks in the Social Internet of Things,"As a huge number of heterogeneous smart things in the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm are connected to exchange services, security principles are needed to ensure safe communication in the network. From this perspective, various Trust Management models have been set forward in the literature in order to assess nodes trustworthiness and therefore to avoid malicious connections in the SIoT network. However, these models still lack practical solutions to address SIoT trust related attacks performed towards the trust evaluation process. In this regard, the present work stands for an in-depth study on the effectiveness of the trust attack management, as it is integrated into the trust model, with the aim of classifying the nodes behaviors more accurately in order to ensure secure connections in the network. For this reason, nodes behaviors analysis, based on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, is carried out within our trust assessment process. Our objective lies in limiting interactions with not only poor service provider, but also with attacker nodes. The proposed trust method's acquired outcome reveals that our introduced TM model demonstrates an improved efficiency in identifying malicious nodes compared to a trust classification algorithm without nodes behaviors evaluation. Experimentation conducted within a simulated dataset based on real social data through Cooja; corroborates the efficiency of our proposed solution in terms of coping with simulated trust related attacks performed by malicious nodes.",Social Internet of Things; Trust management; Secure Communications; Trust related attacks
A social smart city for public and private mobility: A real case study,"Nowadays, smart city paradigm plays a primary role in the fulfillment of sustainable solutions in the field of urban mobility, both public and private. At the same time, the Internet of Things (IoT) is allowing the development of increasingly advanced solutions for real-time management of collected information related to the management and coexistence of vehicles (i.e., buses, cars, trains, bicycles, etc.) immersed in urban and sub-urban traffic. The Social IoT (SIoT) paradigm adds a relational connotation between objects typical of human relationships. Objects operate as equals and request/provide information among them in the perspective of providing IoT services to users while maintaining their individuality. Social object relationship enables the design of solutions aiming to improve the exchange of information among network nodes in terms of security from malicious attacks external to the so-called social network of objects. In this context, a new SIoT smart city solution is presented in this article: private and public vehicles together with pedestrians are involved in a real-time collection of data to improve the viability of the city in order to suggest new directions and information to citizens to better organize how to live the city. The developed architecture presented in this article is equipped with an artificial intelligence that process collected traffic data and, thanks to machine learning techniques, evaluate the directions and flows undertaken by vehicles and pedestrians on a daily basis. The authors are also presenting an application that allow both citizens to live the city in a better way and municipal authorities to promptly manage traffic flows. The proposed system was installed in a specific area of Cagliari (Italy) and the traffic flows have been compared with daily traffic data monitored before the installation, observing an average gain of up to 35 percent in daily traffic reduction.",Smart city; Social IoT; Heterogeneous networks; Devices tracking; Traffic monitoring; Data protection
Deep neural network for text anomaly detection in SIoT,"Unsupervised textual anomaly detection, which discovers anomalies from unlabeled texts, is critical to improve the cybersecurity and interaction ability among the objects in the Social Internet of Things (SIoT). Recently, detecting anomalies by deep neural networks has become a popular trend. Specially, context vector data description (CVDD) method shows the promising performance. However, CVDD has two limitations: (1) it uses an one-class classification objective to constrain the sentence embeddings, which leads the learned embeddings to lose content information of text. (2) Scalar-based attention weights, which are used to extract sentence features, fail to focus on dimensional properties in a word. Learning the text contents and the dimensional properties is important for detection task in SIoT, which can help detector capture the difference between normal and anomaly texts. To overcome these limits, this paper proposes a textual anomaly detection network. First, an adversarial training strategy is designed to fight against the problem of missing content information. Second, a textual anomaly detection module with multiple dimensional transformation matrices is constructed to learn dimensional properties of words in diverse semantic subspaces. Experimental results on several textual datasets show that our proposed method outperforms CVDD and other strong baselines.",Anomaly detection; Text mining; Social Internet of Things (SIoT)
Deep Q-network-based heuristic intrusion detection against edge-based SIoT zero-day attacks,"How to process and classify zero-day attacks due to their huge damage to social Internet of Things (SIoT) systems has become a hot research issue. To solve this issue, we propose a heuristic learning intrusion detection system with Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for edge-based SIoT networks under the scenario of insufficient training samples, which is named DQN-HIDS. It is composed of an SIoT network traffic processing module and a DQN-based heuristic learning network. The SIoT network traffic processing module generates SIoT traffic samples, selects samples entering a classifier and a cybersecurity examiner center, and outputs similarity. We integrate DQN into a heuristic learning network to gradually improve its ability to identify malicious traffic. Specially, reward functions are designed according to the selected actions of the network, in order to punish the behavior of incorrectly labeling malicious samples and make variable reward functions adapt to different execution actions. The LSTM-based DQN then maximizes the cumulative expected reward to find the optimal strategy for the heuristic learning network. Consequently, DQN-HIDS gradually improves the behavior frequency of its labeling, reduces resource workloads, and increases the ability to label SIoT network traffic. Experiments show the performance of DQN-HIDS in terms of the workload of the examiner center and the queue workload of delayed samples, the rewards obtained by the DQN-based heuristic learning network, and the accuracy of the classifier. Comparisons with a state-of-the-art deep learning model and typical machine learning methods are also made, demonstrating the advantages of DQN-HIDS with fewer SIoT network traffic samples.",Social Internet of Things; Zero-day attacks; Intrusion detection system; Deep Q-Networks; Heuristic learning
Distributed attack detection scheme using deep learning approach for Internet of Things,"Cybersecurity continues to be a serious issue for any sector in the cyberspace as the number of security breaches is increasing from time to time. It is known that thousands of zero-day attacks are continuously emerging because of the addition of various protocols mainly from Internet of Things (IoT). Most of these attacks are small variants of previously known cyber-attacks. This indicates that even advanced mechanisms such as traditional machine learning systems face difficulty of detecting these small mutants of attacks over time. On the other hand, the success of deep learning (DL) in various big data fields has drawn several interests in cybersecurity fields. The application of DL has been practical because of the improvement in CPU and neural network algorithms aspects. The use of DL for attack detection in the cyberspace could be a resilient mechanism to small mutations or novel attacks because of its high-level feature extraction capability. The self-taught and compression capabilities of deep learning architectures are key mechanisms for hidden pattern discovery from the training data so that attacks are discriminated from benign traffic. This research is aimed at adopting a new approach, deep learning, to cybersecurity to enable the detection of attacks in social internet of things. The performance of the deep model is compared against traditional machine learning approach, and distributed attack detection is evaluated against the centralized detection system. The experiments have shown that our distributed attack detection system is superior to centralized detection systems using deep learning model. It has also been demonstrated that the deep model is more effective in attack detection than its shallow counter parts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

Edge-aided control dynamics for information diffusion in social Internet of Things,"Information diffusion in social Internet of Things (SIoT) brings convenience to life, but it also faces challenges. The explosive growth of information exceeds the computing capability of the network, making it difficult to control. Motivated by the challenge, a novel control strategy for information diffusion is proposed in SIoT, which is based on the advantages of edge computing with low latency, high energy efficiency and timely feedback. Furthermore, graph neural networks (GNNs) is combined with ordinary differential equation systems (ODEs) to model edge-aided control dynamics, describing high dimensionality and complicated interactions. Theoretical analysis and comparative simulation results show that the proposed edge-aided control strategy can dominate information diffusion within the target scope at the lowest cost.

PAN: Pipeline assisted neural networks model for data-to-text generation in social internet of things,"Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is an emerging paradigm connecting the Internet of things and social networks, enabling the social functions expanded into human-to-thing or interthing. There is an urgent issue of how to realize the social contact for communications between human and things or between things. This requires the natural language generation (NLG), focusing on generating text in human languages from non-linguistic data, which is of vital importance to achieve the interaction without barriers between human and other smart objects in SIoT. However, the existing solutions for data-to-text transformation rely on the specific template and standard neural networks models, which are not flexible when applying to the cross-domain data with diverse meaning. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called pipeline assisted neural networks (PAN), which integrates the traditional pipeline modules and neural generation systems, to conduct data-to-text generation tasks in SIoT. Our new PAN model makes use of attention module and gate mechanism to complete content selection, by analyzing records correlation and filtering redundant records. Then, a dedicated neural network is developed for salient span selection, pointing and transition to achieve content planning. In the end, we conduct experiments on the ROTOWIRE dataset to evaluate the performance of PAN. The results demonstrate that our proposed PAN model outperforms the existing solutions.

Predicting Household Electric Power Consumption Using Multi-step Time Series with Convolutional LSTM,"Energy consumption prediction has become an integral part of a smart and sustainable environment. With future demand forecasts, energy production and distribution can be optimized to meet the needs of the growing population. However, forecasting the demand of individual households is a challenging task due to the diversity of energy consumption patterns. Recently, it has become popular with artificial intelligence-based smart energy-saving designs, smart grid planning and social Internet of Things (IoT) based smart homes. Despite existing approaches for energy demand forecast, predominantly, such systems are based on one-step forecasting and have a short forecasting period. For resolving this issue and obtain high prediction accuracy, this study follows the prediction of household appliances' power in two phases. In the first phase, a long short-term memory (LSTM) based model is used to predict total generative active power for the coming 500 hours. The second phase employs a hybrid deep learning model that combines convolutional characteristics of neural network with LSTM for household electrical energy consumption forecasting of the week ahead utilizing Social IoT-based smart meter readings. Experimental results reveal that the proposed convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) architecture outperforms other models with the lowest root mean square error value of 367 kilowatts for weekly household power consumption.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.

Smart objects recommendation based on pre-training with attention and the thing-thing relationship in social Internet of things,"In Internet of things (IoT) and Social Internet of things (SIoT), how to select or recommend suitable smart objects from an ocean of smart objects has become an increasingly critical issue. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model called BLA (BERT and Bi-LSTM with attention) for smart objects scoring tasks to make recommendations in social Internet of things. The model uses a BERT network to obtain the sentence vectors for a smart object related text, and then uses Bi-LSTM with two types of attention mechanisms to extract representations of the smart object vectors. The devised attention mechanism contains a self-attention (SA) layer and a global-attention (GA) layer. The SA layer is able to estimate the importance of sentences or fields, which in a certain sense can substitute for manually defined features at the sentence and field level. The GA layer can measure the relationships between sentences (or fields) and user requirements, which further helps the model obtain more effective smart object vectors. The thing-thing relationship of Internet of things is introduced into the model to inprove the recommendation effect. Experimental results on the datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms other baseline methods. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

A Multi-View Interactive Approach for Multimodal Sarcasm Detection in Social Internet of Things with Knowledge Enhancement,"Multimodal sarcasm detection is a developing research field in social Internet of Things, which is the foundation of artificial intelligence and human psychology research. Sarcastic comments issued on social media often imply people's real attitudes toward the events they are commenting on, reflecting their current emotional and psychological state. Additionally, the limited memory of Internet of Things mobile devices has posed challenges in deploying sarcastic detection models. An abundance of parameters also leads to an increase in the model's inference time. Social networking platforms such as Twitter and WeChat have generated a large amount of multimodal data. Compared to unimodal data, multimodal data can provide more comprehensive information. Therefore, when studying sarcasm detection on social Internet of Things, it is necessary to simultaneously consider the inter-modal interaction and the number of model parameters. In this paper, we propose a lightweight multimodal interaction model with knowledge enhancement based on deep learning. By integrating visual commonsense knowledge into the sarcasm detection model, we can enrich the semantic information of image and text modal representation. Additionally, we develop a multi-view interaction method to facilitate the interaction between modalities from different modal perspectives. The experimental results indicate that the model proposed in this paper outperforms the unimodal baselines. Compared to multimodal baselines, it also has similar performance with a small number of parameters.",sarcasm detection; multi-view interaction; multimodal
DepTSol: An Improved Deep-Learning- and Time-of-Flight-Based Real-Time Social Distance Monitoring Approach under Various Low-Light Conditions,"Social distancing is an utmost reliable practice to minimise the spread of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As the new variant of COVID-19 is emerging, healthcare organisations are concerned with controlling the death and infection rates. Different COVID-19 vaccines have been developed and administered worldwide. However, presently developed vaccine quantity is not sufficient to fulfil the needs of the world's population. The precautionary measures still rely on personal preventive strategies. The sharp rise in infections has forced governments to reimpose restrictions. Governments are forcing people to maintain at least 6 feet (ft) of safe physical distance to stay safe. With summers, low-light conditions can become challenging. Especially in the cities of underdeveloped countries, where poor ventilated and congested homes cause people to gather in open spaces such as parks, streets, and markets. Besides this, in summer, large friends and family gatherings mostly take place at night. It is necessary to take precautionary measures to avoid more drastic results in such situations. To support the law and order bodies in maintaining social distancing using Social Internet of Things (SIoT), the world is considering automated systems. To address the identification of violations of a social distancing Standard Operating procedure (SOP) in low-light environments via smart, automated cyber-physical solutions, we propose an effective social distance monitoring approach named DepTSol. We propose a low-cost and easy-to-maintain motionless monocular time-of-flight (ToF) camera and deep-learning-based object detection algorithms for real-time social distance monitoring. The proposed approach detects people in low-light environments and calculates their distance in terms of pixels. We convert the predicted pixel distance into real-world units and compare it with the specified safety threshold value. The system highlights people violating the safe distance. The proposed technique is evaluated by COCO evaluation metrics and has achieved a good speed-accuracy trade-off with 51.2 frames per second (fps) and a 99.7% mean average precision (mAP) score. Besides the provision of an effective social distance monitoring approach, we perform a comparative analysis between one-stage object detectors and evaluate their performance in low-light environments.

Improved Feature Selection Based on Chaos Game Optimization for Social Internet of Things with a Novel Deep Learning Model,"The Social Internet of Things (SIoT) ecosystem tends to process and analyze extensive data generated by users from both social networks and Internet of Things (IoT) systems and derives knowledge and diagnoses from all connected objects. To overcome many challenges in the SIoT system, such as big data management, analysis, and reporting, robust algorithms should be proposed and validated. Thus, in this work, we propose a framework to tackle the high dimensionality of transferred data over the SIoT system and improve the performance of several applications with different data types. The proposed framework comprises two parts: Transformer CNN (TransCNN), a deep learning model for feature extraction, and the Chaos Game Optimization (CGO) algorithm for feature selection. To validate the framework's effectiveness, several datasets with different data types were selected, and various experiments were conducted compared to other methods. The results showed that the efficiency of the developed method is better than other models according to the performance metrics in the SIoT environment. In addition, the average of the developed method based on the accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, number of selected features, and fitness value is 88.30%, 87.20%, 92.94%, 44.375, and 0.1082, respectively. The mean rank obtained using the Friedman test is the best value overall for the competitive algorithms.",Social Internet of Things (SIoT); Deep Learning (DL); Chaos Game Optimization (CGO); feature selection
NADAL: A Neighbor-Aware Deep Learning Approach for Inferring Interpersonal Trust Using Smartphone Data,"Interpersonal trust mediates multiple socio-technical systems and has implications for personal and societal well-being. Consequently, it is crucial to devise novel machine learning methods to infer interpersonal trust automatically using mobile sensor-based behavioral data. Considering that social relationships are often affected by neighboring relationships within the same network, this work proposes using a novel neighbor-aware deep learning architecture (NADAL) to enhance the inference of interpersonal trust scores. Based on analysis of call, SMS, and Bluetooth interaction data from a one-year field study involving 130 participants, we report that: (1) adding information about neighboring relationships improves trust score prediction in both shallow and deep learning approaches; and (2) a custom-designed neighbor-aware deep learning architecture outperforms a baseline feature concatenation based deep learning approach. The results obtained at interpersonal trust prediction are promising and have multiple implications for trust-aware applications in the emerging social internet of things.",deep learning; neighbor-aware deep learning; phone data; trust inference
Service Oriented R-ANN Knowledge Model for Social Internet of Things,"Increase in technologies around the world requires adding intelligence to the objects, and making it a smart object in an environment leads to the Social Internet of Things (SIoT). These social objects are uniquely identifiable, transferable and share information from user-to-objects and objects-to objects through interactions in a smart environment such as smart homes, smart cities and many more applications. SIoT faces certain challenges such as handling of heterogeneous objects, selection of generated data in objects, missing values in data. Therefore, the discovery and communication of meaningful patterns in data are more important for every application. Thus, the analysis of data is essential in smarter decisions and qualifies performance of data for various applications. In a smart environment, social networks of intelligent objects are increasing services and decreasing the relationship in a reliable and efficient way of sharing resources and services. Hence, this work proposed the feature selection method based on proposed semantic rules and established the relationships to classify the services using relationship artificial neural networks (R-ANN). R-ANN is an inversely proportional relationship to the objects based on certain rules and conditions between the objects to objects and users to objects. It provides the service oriented knowledge model to make decisions in the proposed R-ANN model that produces service to the users. The proposed R-ANN provides an accuracy of 89.62% for various services namely weather, air quality, parking, light status, and people presence respectively in the SIoT environment compared to the existing model.",SIoT (Social Internet of Things); objects; ANN (Artificial Neural Network); AI (Artificial Intelligence); predictive modeling
