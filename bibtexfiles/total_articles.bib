  abstract             = {The Social Internet of Things (SIoT) ecosystem tends to process and
   analyze extensive data generated by users from both social networks and
   Internet of Things (IoT) systems and derives knowledge and diagnoses
   from all connected objects. To overcome many challenges in the SIoT
   system, such as big data management, analysis, and reporting, robust
   algorithms should be proposed and validated. Thus, in this work, we
   propose a framework to tackle the high dimensionality of transferred
   data over the SIoT system and improve the performance of several
   applications with different data types. The proposed framework comprises
   two parts: Transformer CNN (TransCNN), a deep learning model for feature
   extraction, and the Chaos Game Optimization (CGO) algorithm for feature
   selection. To validate the framework's effectiveness, several datasets
   with different data types were selected, and various experiments were
   conducted compared to other methods. The results showed that the
   efficiency of the developed method is better than other models according
   to the performance metrics in the SIoT environment. In addition, the
   average of the developed method based on the accuracy, sensitivity,
   specificity, number of selected features, and fitness value is 88.30\%,
   87.20\%, 92.94\%, 44.375, and 0.1082, respectively. The mean rank
   obtained using the Friedman test is the best value overall for the
   competitive algorithms.},

   social recommendation (SR) has been an important concern in academia.
   However, current research on SR universally faces two main challenges.
   On the one hand, SR lacks the considerable ability of robust online data
   management. On the other hand, SR fails to take the ambiguity of
   preference feedback into consideration. To bridge these gaps, a deep
   learning-embedded social Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed for
   ambiguity-aware SR (SIoT-SR). Specifically, a social IoT architecture is
   developed for social computing scenarios to guarantee reliable data
   management. A deep learning-based graph neural network model that can be
   embedded into the model is proposed as the core algorithm to perform
   ambiguity-aware SR. This design not only provides proper online data
   sensing and management but also overcomes the preference ambiguity
   problem in SR. To evaluate the performance of the proposed SIoT-SR, two
   real-world datasets are selected to establish experimental scenarios.
   The method is assessed using three different metrics, selecting five
   typical methods as benchmarks. The experimental results show that the
   proposed SIoT-SR performs better than the benchmark methods by at least
   10\% and has good robustness.},

  abstract      = {Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is an emerging paradigm connecting the
   Internet of things and social networks, enabling the social functions
   expanded into human-to-thing or interthing. There is an urgent issue of
   how to realize the social contact for communications between human and
   things or between things. This requires the natural language generation
   (NLG), focusing on generating text in human languages from
   non-linguistic data, which is of vital importance to achieve the
   interaction without barriers between human and other smart objects in
   SIoT. However, the existing solutions for data-to-text transformation
   rely on the specific template and standard neural networks models, which
   are not flexible when applying to the cross-domain data with diverse
   meaning. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called pipeline
   assisted neural networks (PAN), which integrates the traditional
   pipeline modules and neural generation systems, to conduct data-to-text
   generation tasks in SIoT. Our new PAN model makes use of attention
   module and gate mechanism to complete content selection, by analyzing
   records correlation and filtering redundant records. Then, a dedicated
   neural network is developed for salient span selection, pointing and
   transition to achieve content planning. In the end, we conduct
   experiments on the ROTOWIRE dataset to evaluate the performance of PAN.
   The results demonstrate that our proposed PAN model outperforms the
   existing solutions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract        = {Unsupervised textual anomaly detection, which discovers anomalies from
   unlabeled texts, is critical to improve the cybersecurity and
   interaction ability among the objects in the Social Internet of Things
   (SIoT). Recently, detecting anomalies by deep neural networks has become
   a popular trend. Specially, context vector data description (CVDD)
   method shows the promising performance. However, CVDD has two
   limitations: (1) it uses an one-class classification objective to
   constrain the sentence embeddings, which leads the learned embeddings to
   lose content information of text. (2) Scalar-based attention weights,
   which are used to extract sentence features, fail to focus on
   dimensional properties in a word. Learning the text contents and the
   dimensional properties is important for detection task in SIoT, which
   can help detector capture the difference between normal and anomaly
   texts. To overcome these limits, this paper proposes a textual anomaly
   detection network. First, an adversarial training strategy is designed
   to fight against the problem of missing content information. Second, a
   textual anomaly detection module with multiple dimensional
   transformation matrices is constructed to learn dimensional properties
   of words in diverse semantic subspaces. Experimental results on several
   textual datasets show that our proposed method outperforms CVDD and
   other strong baselines.},

  abstract      = {Text sentiment classification is of critical importance to improve the
   autonomous decision making and communication ability among object peers
   in the Social Internet of Things (SIoT). To classify sentiment polarity
   on a fine-grained level, aspect-level sentiment classification has
   become a promising direction in recent years. However, the existing
   solutions typically ignore the mutual information between sentences and
   their respective aspect terms while generally performing sentiment
   classification by using the simple attention mechanism. Thus, the
   relevant results seem to be unpromising. We aim to develop a novel
   neural-network-based model, by relying on the natural language
   processing model for rich feature extraction, called mutual attention
   neural networks (MANs), to conduct the aspect-level sentiment
   classification tasks in this article. Compared with the previous work,
   our proposed MAN model takes advantage of the bidirectional long
   short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) networks to obtain semantic dependence of
   sentences and their respective aspect terms, while learning the
   sentiment polarities of aspect terms in sentences by proposing the
   mutual attention mechanism. To evaluate the performance of MAN, we
   conduct our experiments on three real-world data sets, i.e., LAPTOP,
   REST, and TWITTER. The experimental results show that our proposed MAN
   model has significant performance improvements when compared to several
   existing models, in terms of aspect-level sentiment classification.},

   certain challenges such as handling of heterogeneous objects, selection

   reliable and efficient way of sharing resources and services. Hence,
   this work proposed the feature selection method based on proposed
   semantic rules and established the relationships to classify the
   services using relationship artificial neural networks (R-ANN). R-ANN is
   an inversely proportional relationship to the objects based on certain
   rules and conditions between the objects to objects and users to

   storage, and network connection resources for remote devices. Because
   the edge network is closer to the connected devices, it involves a large

   attacker nodes. The proposed trust method's acquired outcome reveals
   that our introduced TM model demonstrates an improved efficiency in
   identifying malicious nodes compared to a trust classification algorithm
   without nodes behaviors evaluation. Experimentation conducted within a
   simulated dataset based on real social data through Cooja; corroborates
   the efficiency of our proposed solution in terms of coping with
   simulated trust related attacks performed by malicious nodes.},

  abstract             = {How to process and classify zero-day attacks due to their huge damage to
   social Internet of Things (SIoT) systems has become a hot research
   issue. To solve this issue, we propose a heuristic learning intrusion
   detection system with Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for edge-based SIoT networks
   under the scenario of insufficient training samples, which is named
   DQN-HIDS. It is composed of an SIoT network traffic processing module
   and a DQN-based heuristic learning network. The SIoT network traffic
   processing module generates SIoT traffic samples, selects samples
   entering a classifier and a cybersecurity examiner center, and outputs
   similarity. We integrate DQN into a heuristic learning network to
   gradually improve its ability to identify malicious traffic. Specially,
   reward functions are designed according to the selected actions of the
   network, in order to punish the behavior of incorrectly labeling
   malicious samples and make variable reward functions adapt to different
   execution actions. The LSTM-based DQN then maximizes the cumulative
   expected reward to find the optimal strategy for the heuristic learning
   network. Consequently, DQN-HIDS gradually improves the behavior
   frequency of its labeling, reduces resource workloads, and increases the
   ability to label SIoT network traffic. Experiments show the performance
   of DQN-HIDS in terms of the workload of the examiner center and the
   queue workload of delayed samples, the rewards obtained by the DQN-based
   heuristic learning network, and the accuracy of the classifier.
   Comparisons with a state-of-the-art deep learning model and typical
   machine learning methods are also made, demonstrating the advantages of
   DQN-HIDS with fewer SIoT network traffic samples.},

   application scenarios of the Internet of Things (IoT) are progressively
   expanding to the social field, engendering widespread attention to the
   Social IoT (SIoT). Personalized fashion recommendation that possesses
   the potential to establish social relationships between clothing and
   humans has substantially broadened the scope of the SIoT, particularly
   with the flourishing fashion industry and the ascent of smart home.
   Compared to conventional recommendations, fashion recommendation
   generally suggests a collection of items rather than individual pieces
   for users. Additionally, considering the public acceptance alongside the
   user-specific preference is reasonable for fashion recommendation,
   however, current methods often overlook the former. To comprehensively
   capture the public acceptance and the user-specific preference, we
   propose a dual preference perception network (DP2Net) for fashion
   recommendation. First, a fashion corpus is constructed to facilitate the
   condensation of general taste, wherein adversarial learning and
   determinantal point process are leveraged to ensure representativeness
   and diversity of the corpus. Second, a user-general preference
   perception module is built based on a bottleneck transformer structure
   to generate aggregated representations for the corpus. Third, a
   user-specific preference perception module is constructed to acquire
   collaborative representations of users and outfits by employing an
   attentive heterogeneous graph embedding. The final loss functions of two
   preference perception modules are constructed by combining the
   representations of users, outfits, and the corpus. Experiments on
   large-scale real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed method. To facilitate reproducible research, we have made our
   code publicly available at https://github.com/KaiZhang1228/DP2Net.},

   self-attention (SA) layer and a global-attention (GA) layer. The SA
   layer is able to estimate the importance of sentences or fields, which
   in a certain sense can substitute for manually defined features at the
   sentence and field level. The GA layer can measure the relationships
   between sentences (or fields) and user requirements, which further helps
   the model obtain more effective smart object vectors. The thing-thing

   inprove the recommendation effect. Experimental results on the datasets

   emerging because of the addition of various protocols mainly from
   Internet of Things (IoT). Most of these attacks are small variants of
   previously known cyber-attacks. This indicates that even advanced
   mechanisms such as traditional machine learning systems face difficulty
   of detecting these small mutants of attacks over time. On the other
   hand, the success of deep learning (DL) in various big data fields has
   drawn several interests in cybersecurity fields. The application of DL
   has been practical because of the improvement in CPU and neural network
   algorithms aspects. The use of DL for attack detection in the cyberspace
   could be a resilient mechanism to small mutations or novel attacks
   because of its high-level feature extraction capability. The self-taught
   and compression capabilities of deep learning architectures are key
   mechanisms for hidden pattern discovery from the training data so that
   attacks are discriminated from benign traffic. This research is aimed at
   adopting a new approach, deep learning, to cybersecurity to enable the
   detection of attacks in social internet of things. The performance of
   the deep model is compared against traditional machine learning
   approach, and distributed attack detection is evaluated against the
   centralized detection system. The experiments have shown that our
   distributed attack detection system is superior to centralized detection
   systems using deep learning model. It has also been demonstrated that

   often imply people's real attitudes toward the events they are
   commenting on, reflecting their current emotional and psychological
   state. Additionally, the limited memory of Internet of Things mobile
   devices has posed challenges in deploying sarcastic detection models. An
   abundance of parameters also leads to an increase in the model's

   Therefore, when studying sarcasm detection on social Internet of Things,
   it is necessary to simultaneously consider the inter-modal interaction
   and the number of model parameters. In this paper, we propose a
   lightweight multimodal interaction model with knowledge enhancement
   based on deep learning. By integrating visual commonsense knowledge into
   the sarcasm detection model, we can enrich the semantic information of
   image and text modal representation. Additionally, we develop a
   multi-view interaction method to facilitate the interaction between

   of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As the new variant of COVID-19 is
   emerging, healthcare organisations are concerned with controlling the
   death and infection rates. Different COVID-19 vaccines have been
   developed and administered worldwide. However, presently developed
   vaccine quantity is not sufficient to fulfil the needs of the world's
   population. The precautionary measures still rely on personal preventive
   strategies. The sharp rise in infections has forced governments to
   reimpose restrictions. Governments are forcing people to maintain at
   least 6 feet (ft) of safe physical distance to stay safe. With summers,
   low-light conditions can become challenging. Especially in the cities of
   underdeveloped countries, where poor ventilated and congested homes
   cause people to gather in open spaces such as parks, streets, and
   markets. Besides this, in summer, large friends and family gatherings
   mostly take place at night. It is necessary to take precautionary
   measures to avoid more drastic results in such situations. To support
   the law and order bodies in maintaining social distancing using Social
   Internet of Things (SIoT), the world is considering automated systems.
   To address the identification of violations of a social distancing
   Standard Operating procedure (SOP) in low-light environments via smart,
   automated cyber-physical solutions, we propose an effective social
   distance monitoring approach named DepTSol. We propose a low-cost and
   easy-to-maintain motionless monocular time-of-flight (ToF) camera and
   deep-learning-based object detection algorithms for real-time social
   distance monitoring. The proposed approach detects people in low-light
   environments and calculates their distance in terms of pixels. We
   convert the predicted pixel distance into real-world units and compare
   it with the specified safety threshold value. The system highlights
   people violating the safe distance. The proposed technique is evaluated
   by COCO evaluation metrics and has achieved a good speed-accuracy
   trade-off with 51.2 frames per second (fps) and a 99.7\% mean average
   precision (mAP) score. Besides the provision of an effective social
   distance monitoring approach, we perform a comparative analysis between
   one-stage object detectors and evaluate their performance in low-light
   environments. This evaluation will pave the way for researchers to study
   the field further and will enlighten the efficiency of deep-learning
   algorithms in timely responsive real-world applications.},

  abstract             = {Security is a critical element to the existing Internet of Things (IoT)
   deployment, where any user may actively or passively attack the content
   sharing of others reusing the same channel. As most smart devices are
   carried by human, we may leverage their owners' social trust to avoid
   being intercepted by untrusted users, which conforms to the Social
   Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm. In this paper, we propose a secure
   content sharing (SCS) scheme to strike the trade-off between security
   and quality of experience (QoE) by exploring the social trust. Firstly,
   to dynamically extract the social trust, the random walk strategy is
   employed for prediction based on the proposed ``User-Content-Social
   Group{''} graph which models users' preference over time. Given the
   social trust value, we propose a hierarchical game model to decouple the
   optimization problem into two sub-problems: user pairing and channel
   selection. More specifically, the user pairing sub-problem is formulated
   as a matching sub-game with peer effect, and the embedded rotation-swap
   matching algorithm can accommodate the dynamics caused by mutual
   interference. The second sub-problem can be formulated as a secure
   channel selection sub-game with the directed hypergraph being game
   space, which is proved to be an exact potential game. Then, we design an
   uncoupled-user concurrent learning algorithm (UUCL) to search for the

   playing an important role in our daily life. How to provide personalized
   information to users is the core concern of Internet content service
   providers. To improve the recommendation quality, it is a hot topic to
   go beyond merely user-item interaction records and take social relations
   into account in IoT. Recently, emerged graph neural networks (GNNs)
   shine a light on simulating the recursive social diffusion process, to
   refine user embedding learning. Nevertheless, two key issues have not
   been well studied in previous studies: 1) they usually model user
   preference and social influence within a same semantic space and fail to
   simultaneously inject high-order connectivity information reflected in
   both user-item interaction graph and user-user social graph and 2) they
   typically rely on negative sampling to optimize a recommendation model,
   which makes them highly sensitive to the design of the sampler and
   hardly makes full use of GPU's computing ability. In light of this, we
   propose a novel framework for item recommendation, namely, an efficient
   adaptive graph convolutional network (EAGCN). Specifically, we introduce
   a space-adaptive graph convolutional module, which could jointly explore
   the propagation process of user interest and social influence.
   Furthermore, a user-specific gating mechanism is designed to aggregate
   user representations from both spaces. To make EAGCN practical in social
   IoT, we devise a fast nonsampling leaner to optimize EAGCN's parameters
   with better leveraging matrix computing of GPU. Extensive experiments
   under four scenarios show that our solution consistently and
   significantly outperforms strong baseline methods in both model
   effectiveness and training efficiency.},

  abstract      = {Device Classification (DC) is one of the critical network management
   means in the Internet of Things (IoT). Most machine learning-driven DC
   methods are implemented in two steps: firstly, extracting device
   features, and then training the classifier. Thus, for the same
   classifier, the quality of device features plays a decisive role.
   However, for one thing, these methods usually merely consider device
   traffic or device attributed features, ignoring the complex relationship
   between devices in Social IoT. For another thing, these features fed to
   the classifier are often selected manually without automatic learning.
   These two factors seriously affect the performance and flexibility of
   the algorithm. To address the above issues, we propose a novel Graph
   Contrastive Neural Network-based algorithm for DC dubbed GCNNDC.
   Specifically, based on the complex relationship between heterogeneous
   objects in Social IoT and the attribute information of the device
   itself, we first construct four kinds of homogeneous device-device
   attributed networks as the input of the neural network. Then, we train a
   novel GCNN model to learn informative device features in a
   self-supervised learning fashion. Finally, we leverage the features to
   train a classifier to complete the DC task. Experimental results on
   real-world IoT network dataset demonstrate the superiority of GCNNDC.},

   smart cities raises compatibility and trustworthiness challenges,
   hindering conventional service discovery and network navigability
   processes. The IoT network is known for its highly dynamic topology and
   frequently changing characteristics (e.g., the devices' status, such as
   battery capacity and computational power); traditional methods fail to
   learn and understand the evolving behavior of the network to enable
   real-time and context-aware service discovery in such diverse and
   large-scale topologies of IoT networks. The Social IoT (SIoT) concept,
   which defines the relationships among the connected objects, can be
   exploited to extract established relationships between devices and
   enable trustworthy and context-aware services. In fact, SIoT expresses
   the possible connections that devices can establish in the network and
   reflect compatibility, trustworthiness, and so on. In this paper, we
   investigate the service discovery process in SIoT networks by proposing
   a low-complexity context-aware Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to
   enable rapid and dynamic service discovery. Unlike the conventional
   graph-based techniques, the proposed approach simultaneously embeds the
   devices' features and their SIoT relations. Our simulations on a
   real-world IoT dataset show that the proposed GNN-based approach can
   provide more concise clusters compared to traditional techniques, namely
   the Louvain and Leiden algorithms. This allows a better IoT network
   learning and understanding and also, speeds up the service lookup search

   by SIoT necessitates efficient information processing frameworks to
   exploit social relationships and comprehend actionable information from
   real-world observations. Data from AI-enabled sensors (AIS) is typically
   geo-tagged, thus demanding geo-textual processing for information
   retrieval and analysis. Social media applications are the main source of
   geo-textual data as mobile users connect with millions of posts daily.
   The processing of big geo-textual data requires resource-efficient
   algorithms and frameworks. Clustering algorithms are often applied to
   geo-textual data to examine spatial, textual, and temporal information
   for event detection, sentiment analysis, and search query response.
   Clustering algorithms on big data are resource-hungry requiring

   Social Internet of Things, which is an integral part of
   cyber-physical-social systems. Online social media platforms, as the
   most active places where users act as social sensors, are responsive to

   in real time. Unfortunately, posts rarely contain structured geographic
   information, thus hindering their usage for contributing to various

   introducing a general approach for extracting place names from tweets,
   named GazPNE2. It combines global gazetteers (i.e., OpenStreetMap and
   GeoNames), deep learning, and pretrained transformer models (i.e., BERT
   and BERTweet), which requires no manually annotated data. It can extract
   place names at both coarse (e.g., city) and fine-grained (e.g., street
   and POI) levels and place names with abbreviations. To fully evaluate
   GazPNE2 and compare it with 11 competing approaches, we use 19 public
   tweet data sets, containing 38 802 tweets and 22 197 places across the
   world. The results show GazPNE2 achieves a much higher F1 (0.8) than the

   coronavirus disease 2019), containing 560 040 tweets. An F1 of 0.84 is

   Recently, it has become popular with artificial intelligence-based smart
