  abstract             = {The Social Internet of Things (SIoT) ecosystem tends to process and
   analyze extensive data generated by users from both social networks and
   Internet of Things (IoT) systems and derives knowledge and diagnoses
   from all connected objects. To overcome many challenges in the SIoT
   system, such as big data management, analysis, and reporting, robust
   algorithms should be proposed and validated. Thus, in this work, we
   propose a framework to tackle the high dimensionality of transferred
   data over the SIoT system and improve the performance of several
   applications with different data types. The proposed framework comprises
   two parts: Transformer CNN (TransCNN), a deep learning model for feature
   extraction, and the Chaos Game Optimization (CGO) algorithm for feature
   selection. To validate the framework's effectiveness, several datasets
   with different data types were selected, and various experiments were
   conducted compared to other methods. The results showed that the
   efficiency of the developed method is better than other models according
   to the performance metrics in the SIoT environment. In addition, the
   average of the developed method based on the accuracy, sensitivity,
   specificity, number of selected features, and fitness value is 88.30\%,
   87.20\%, 92.94\%, 44.375, and 0.1082, respectively. The mean rank
   obtained using the Friedman test is the best value overall for the
   competitive algorithms.},

  abstract             = {Increase in technologies around the world requires adding intelligence
   to the objects, and making it a smart object in an environment leads to
   the Social Internet of Things (SIoT). These social objects are uniquely
   identifiable, transferable and share information from user-to-objects
   and objects-to objects through interactions in a smart environment such
   as smart homes, smart cities and many more applications. SIoT faces
   certain challenges such as handling of heterogeneous objects, selection
   of generated data in objects, missing values in data. Therefore, the
   discovery and communication of meaningful patterns in data are more
   important for every application. Thus, the analysis of data is essential
   in smarter decisions and qualifies performance of data for various
   applications. In a smart environment, social networks of intelligent
   objects are increasing services and decreasing the relationship in a
   reliable and efficient way of sharing resources and services. Hence,
   this work proposed the feature selection method based on proposed
   semantic rules and established the relationships to classify the
   services using relationship artificial neural networks (R-ANN). R-ANN is
   an inversely proportional relationship to the objects based on certain
   rules and conditions between the objects to objects and users to
   objects. It provides the service oriented knowledge model to make
   decisions in the proposed R-ANN model that produces service to the
   users. The proposed R-ANN provides an accuracy of 89.62\% for various
   services namely weather, air quality, parking, light status, and people
   presence respectively in the SIoT environment compared to the existing
   model.},

   Considering that social relationships are often affected by neighboring

   neighbor-aware deep learning architecture (NADAL) to enhance the
   inference of interpersonal trust scores. Based on analysis of call, SMS,
   and Bluetooth interaction data from a one-year field study involving 130
   participants, we report that: (1) adding information about neighboring
   relationships improves trust score prediction in both shallow and deep
   learning approaches; and (2) a custom-designed neighbor-aware deep
   learning architecture outperforms a baseline feature concatenation based
   deep learning approach. The results obtained at interpersonal trust
   prediction are promising and have multiple implications for trust-aware
   applications in the emerging social internet of things.},

  abstract       = {Multimodal sarcasm detection is a developing research field in social
   Internet of Things, which is the foundation of artificial intelligence
   and human psychology research. Sarcastic comments issued on social media
   often imply people's real attitudes toward the events they are
   commenting on, reflecting their current emotional and psychological
   state. Additionally, the limited memory of Internet of Things mobile
   devices has posed challenges in deploying sarcastic detection models. An
   abundance of parameters also leads to an increase in the model's
   inference time. Social networking platforms such as Twitter and WeChat
   have generated a large amount of multimodal data. Compared to unimodal
   data, multimodal data can provide more comprehensive information.
   Therefore, when studying sarcasm detection on social Internet of Things,
   it is necessary to simultaneously consider the inter-modal interaction
   and the number of model parameters. In this paper, we propose a
   lightweight multimodal interaction model with knowledge enhancement
   based on deep learning. By integrating visual commonsense knowledge into
   the sarcasm detection model, we can enrich the semantic information of
   image and text modal representation. Additionally, we develop a
   multi-view interaction method to facilitate the interaction between
   modalities from different modal perspectives. The experimental results
   indicate that the model proposed in this paper outperforms the unimodal
   baselines. Compared to multimodal baselines, it also has similar
   performance with a small number of parameters.},

  abstract             = {Social distancing is an utmost reliable practice to minimise the spread
   of coronavirus disease (COVID-19). As the new variant of COVID-19 is
   emerging, healthcare organisations are concerned with controlling the
   death and infection rates. Different COVID-19 vaccines have been
   developed and administered worldwide. However, presently developed
   vaccine quantity is not sufficient to fulfil the needs of the world's
   population. The precautionary measures still rely on personal preventive
   strategies. The sharp rise in infections has forced governments to
   reimpose restrictions. Governments are forcing people to maintain at
   least 6 feet (ft) of safe physical distance to stay safe. With summers,
   low-light conditions can become challenging. Especially in the cities of
   underdeveloped countries, where poor ventilated and congested homes
   cause people to gather in open spaces such as parks, streets, and
   markets. Besides this, in summer, large friends and family gatherings
   mostly take place at night. It is necessary to take precautionary
   measures to avoid more drastic results in such situations. To support
   the law and order bodies in maintaining social distancing using Social
   Internet of Things (SIoT), the world is considering automated systems.
   To address the identification of violations of a social distancing
   Standard Operating procedure (SOP) in low-light environments via smart,
   automated cyber-physical solutions, we propose an effective social
   distance monitoring approach named DepTSol. We propose a low-cost and
   easy-to-maintain motionless monocular time-of-flight (ToF) camera and
   deep-learning-based object detection algorithms for real-time social
   distance monitoring. The proposed approach detects people in low-light
   environments and calculates their distance in terms of pixels. We
   convert the predicted pixel distance into real-world units and compare
   it with the specified safety threshold value. The system highlights
   people violating the safe distance. The proposed technique is evaluated
   by COCO evaluation metrics and has achieved a good speed-accuracy
   trade-off with 51.2 frames per second (fps) and a 99.7\% mean average
   precision (mAP) score. Besides the provision of an effective social
   distance monitoring approach, we perform a comparative analysis between
   one-stage object detectors and evaluate their performance in low-light
   environments. This evaluation will pave the way for researchers to study
   the field further and will enlighten the efficiency of deep-learning
   algorithms in timely responsive real-world applications.},
