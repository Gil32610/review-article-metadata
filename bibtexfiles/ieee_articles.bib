   social recommendation (SR) has been an important concern in academia.
   However, current research on SR universally faces two main challenges.
   On the one hand, SR lacks the considerable ability of robust online data
   management. On the other hand, SR fails to take the ambiguity of
   preference feedback into consideration. To bridge these gaps, a deep
   learning-embedded social Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed for
   ambiguity-aware SR (SIoT-SR). Specifically, a social IoT architecture is
   developed for social computing scenarios to guarantee reliable data
   management. A deep learning-based graph neural network model that can be
   embedded into the model is proposed as the core algorithm to perform
   ambiguity-aware SR. This design not only provides proper online data
   sensing and management but also overcomes the preference ambiguity
   problem in SR. To evaluate the performance of the proposed SIoT-SR, two
   real-world datasets are selected to establish experimental scenarios.
   The method is assessed using three different metrics, selecting five
   typical methods as benchmarks. The experimental results show that the
   proposed SIoT-SR performs better than the benchmark methods by at least
   10\% and has good robustness.},

   autonomous decision making and communication ability among object peers
   in the Social Internet of Things (SIoT). To classify sentiment polarity
   on a fine-grained level, aspect-level sentiment classification has
   become a promising direction in recent years. However, the existing
   solutions typically ignore the mutual information between sentences and
   their respective aspect terms while generally performing sentiment
   classification by using the simple attention mechanism. Thus, the
   relevant results seem to be unpromising. We aim to develop a novel
   neural-network-based model, by relying on the natural language
   processing model for rich feature extraction, called mutual attention
   neural networks (MANs), to conduct the aspect-level sentiment
   classification tasks in this article. Compared with the previous work,
   our proposed MAN model takes advantage of the bidirectional long
   short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) networks to obtain semantic dependence of
   sentences and their respective aspect terms, while learning the
   sentiment polarities of aspect terms in sentences by proposing the
   mutual attention mechanism. To evaluate the performance of MAN, we
   conduct our experiments on three real-world data sets, i.e., LAPTOP,
   REST, and TWITTER. The experimental results show that our proposed MAN
   model has significant performance improvements when compared to several
   existing models, in terms of aspect-level sentiment classification.},

   a strategy to alleviate the escalation of resource congestion,
   collaborative edge computing (CEC) has become a new paradigm for solving
   the needs of the Internet of Things (IoT). CEC can provide computing,
   storage, and network connection resources for remote devices. Because
   the edge network is closer to the connected devices, it involves a large
   amount of users' privacy. This also makes edge networks face more and
   more security issues, such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks,
   unauthorized access, packet sniffing, and man-in-the-middle attacks. To
   combat these issues and enhance the security of edge networks, we

   intrusion detection method. Our intrusion detection method includes
   three phases. First, we use the feature selection module to process the
   collaborative edge network traffic. Second, a deep learning architecture
   based on GAN is designed for intrusion detection aiming at a single
   attack. Finally, we propose a new intrusion detection model by combining
   several intrusion detection models that aim at a single attack.
   Intrusion detection aiming at multiple attacks is realized through the

   application scenarios of the Internet of Things (IoT) are progressively
   expanding to the social field, engendering widespread attention to the
   Social IoT (SIoT). Personalized fashion recommendation that possesses
   the potential to establish social relationships between clothing and
   humans has substantially broadened the scope of the SIoT, particularly
   with the flourishing fashion industry and the ascent of smart home.
   Compared to conventional recommendations, fashion recommendation
   generally suggests a collection of items rather than individual pieces
   for users. Additionally, considering the public acceptance alongside the
   user-specific preference is reasonable for fashion recommendation,
   however, current methods often overlook the former. To comprehensively
   capture the public acceptance and the user-specific preference, we
   propose a dual preference perception network (DP2Net) for fashion
   recommendation. First, a fashion corpus is constructed to facilitate the
   condensation of general taste, wherein adversarial learning and
   determinantal point process are leveraged to ensure representativeness
   and diversity of the corpus. Second, a user-general preference
   perception module is built based on a bottleneck transformer structure
   to generate aggregated representations for the corpus. Third, a
   user-specific preference perception module is constructed to acquire
   collaborative representations of users and outfits by employing an
   attentive heterogeneous graph embedding. The final loss functions of two
   preference perception modules are constructed by combining the
   representations of users, outfits, and the corpus. Experiments on
   large-scale real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the
   proposed method. To facilitate reproducible research, we have made our

   carried by human, we may leverage their owners' social trust to avoid
   being intercepted by untrusted users, which conforms to the Social
   Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm. In this paper, we propose a secure
   content sharing (SCS) scheme to strike the trade-off between security
   and quality of experience (QoE) by exploring the social trust. Firstly,
   to dynamically extract the social trust, the random walk strategy is
   employed for prediction based on the proposed ``User-Content-Social
   Group{''} graph which models users' preference over time. Given the
   social trust value, we propose a hierarchical game model to decouple the
   optimization problem into two sub-problems: user pairing and channel
   selection. More specifically, the user pairing sub-problem is formulated
   as a matching sub-game with peer effect, and the embedded rotation-swap
   matching algorithm can accommodate the dynamics caused by mutual
   interference. The second sub-problem can be formulated as a secure
   channel selection sub-game with the directed hypergraph being game
   space, which is proved to be an exact potential game. Then, we design an
   uncoupled-user concurrent learning algorithm (UUCL) to search for the
   optimal pure Nash equilibrium, and thereby the global optimum of this
   sub-game is achieved. Finally, simulation results generated on realistic

   playing an important role in our daily life. How to provide personalized
   information to users is the core concern of Internet content service
   providers. To improve the recommendation quality, it is a hot topic to
   go beyond merely user-item interaction records and take social relations
   into account in IoT. Recently, emerged graph neural networks (GNNs)
   shine a light on simulating the recursive social diffusion process, to
   refine user embedding learning. Nevertheless, two key issues have not
   been well studied in previous studies: 1) they usually model user
   preference and social influence within a same semantic space and fail to
   simultaneously inject high-order connectivity information reflected in
   both user-item interaction graph and user-user social graph and 2) they
   typically rely on negative sampling to optimize a recommendation model,
   which makes them highly sensitive to the design of the sampler and
   hardly makes full use of GPU's computing ability. In light of this, we
   propose a novel framework for item recommendation, namely, an efficient
   adaptive graph convolutional network (EAGCN). Specifically, we introduce
   a space-adaptive graph convolutional module, which could jointly explore
   the propagation process of user interest and social influence.
   Furthermore, a user-specific gating mechanism is designed to aggregate
   user representations from both spaces. To make EAGCN practical in social
   IoT, we devise a fast nonsampling leaner to optimize EAGCN's parameters
   with better leveraging matrix computing of GPU. Extensive experiments

   means in the Internet of Things (IoT). Most machine learning-driven DC
   methods are implemented in two steps: firstly, extracting device
   features, and then training the classifier. Thus, for the same
   classifier, the quality of device features plays a decisive role.
   However, for one thing, these methods usually merely consider device
   traffic or device attributed features, ignoring the complex relationship
   between devices in Social IoT. For another thing, these features fed to
   the classifier are often selected manually without automatic learning.
   These two factors seriously affect the performance and flexibility of
   the algorithm. To address the above issues, we propose a novel Graph
   Contrastive Neural Network-based algorithm for DC dubbed GCNNDC.
   Specifically, based on the complex relationship between heterogeneous
   objects in Social IoT and the attribute information of the device
   itself, we first construct four kinds of homogeneous device-device
   attributed networks as the input of the neural network. Then, we train a
   novel GCNN model to learn informative device features in a
   self-supervised learning fashion. Finally, we leverage the features to
   train a classifier to complete the DC task. Experimental results on

  abstract             = {Adopting Internet-of-things (IoT) in large-scale environments such as
   smart cities raises compatibility and trustworthiness challenges,
   hindering conventional service discovery and network navigability
   processes. The IoT network is known for its highly dynamic topology and
   frequently changing characteristics (e.g., the devices' status, such as
   battery capacity and computational power); traditional methods fail to
   learn and understand the evolving behavior of the network to enable
   real-time and context-aware service discovery in such diverse and
   large-scale topologies of IoT networks. The Social IoT (SIoT) concept,
   which defines the relationships among the connected objects, can be
   exploited to extract established relationships between devices and
   enable trustworthy and context-aware services. In fact, SIoT expresses
   the possible connections that devices can establish in the network and
   reflect compatibility, trustworthiness, and so on. In this paper, we
   investigate the service discovery process in SIoT networks by proposing
   a low-complexity context-aware Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to
   enable rapid and dynamic service discovery. Unlike the conventional
   graph-based techniques, the proposed approach simultaneously embeds the
   devices' features and their SIoT relations. Our simulations on a
   real-world IoT dataset show that the proposed GNN-based approach can
   provide more concise clusters compared to traditional techniques, namely
   the Louvain and Leiden algorithms. This allows a better IoT network
   learning and understanding and also, speeds up the service lookup search
   space. Finally, we discuss implementing the GNN-assisted context-service
   discovery processes in novel smart city IoT-enabled applications.},

   networking concepts with the Internet of Things (IoT) solutions to
   support novel services. The massive amount of data (big data) produced
   by SIoT necessitates efficient information processing frameworks to
   exploit social relationships and comprehend actionable information from
   real-world observations. Data from AI-enabled sensors (AIS) is typically
   geo-tagged, thus demanding geo-textual processing for information
   retrieval and analysis. Social media applications are the main source of
   geo-textual data as mobile users connect with millions of posts daily.
   The processing of big geo-textual data requires resource-efficient
   algorithms and frameworks. Clustering algorithms are often applied to
   geo-textual data to examine spatial, textual, and temporal information
   for event detection, sentiment analysis, and search query response.
   Clustering algorithms on big data are resource-hungry requiring
   comparisons among all data points to calculate similarity and distance
   metrics. Existing hybrid clustering techniques execute algorithms
   collectively on geo-textual data resulting in a enormous footprint for
   big data. We propose a resource-efficient clustering framework for AIS
   that hierarchically performs geo-textual clustering without
   significantly lowering the clustering quality. The proposed framework
   achieves substantial time and memory efficiency while reducing the
   overall resource requirements for constrained end-user and edge devices
   compared to the standard hybrid geo-textual clustering framework.
   Moreover, we augment the research work by developing open-source scripts
   for both hierarchical and hybrid clustering frameworks.},

  abstract             = {The concept of ``human as sensors{''} defines a new sensing model, in
   which humans act as sensors by contributing their observations,
   perceptions, and sensations. This is crucial for the development of
   Social Internet of Things, which is an integral part of
   cyber-physical-social systems. Online social media platforms, as the
   most active places where users act as social sensors, are responsive to
   real-world events and are useful for gathering situational information
   in real time. Unfortunately, posts rarely contain structured geographic
   information, thus hindering their usage for contributing to various
   challenges, such as emergency response. We address this limitation by
   introducing a general approach for extracting place names from tweets,
   named GazPNE2. It combines global gazetteers (i.e., OpenStreetMap and
   GeoNames), deep learning, and pretrained transformer models (i.e., BERT
   and BERTweet), which requires no manually annotated data. It can extract
   place names at both coarse (e.g., city) and fine-grained (e.g., street
   and POI) levels and place names with abbreviations. To fully evaluate
   GazPNE2 and compare it with 11 competing approaches, we use 19 public
   tweet data sets, containing 38 802 tweets and 22 197 places across the
   world. The results show GazPNE2 achieves a much higher F1 (0.8) than the
   other approaches. Furthermore, we apply GazPNE2 to three large
   unannotated tweet data sets related to over 20 crisis events (e.g.,
   coronavirus disease 2019), containing 560 040 tweets. An F1 of 0.84 is
   achieved on 3000 tweets, which are randomly selected from the three data
   sets and then manually annotated. Code and data are available on GitHub
