  abstract      = {Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is an emerging paradigm connecting the
   Internet of things and social networks, enabling the social functions
   expanded into human-to-thing or interthing. There is an urgent issue of
   how to realize the social contact for communications between human and
   things or between things. This requires the natural language generation
   (NLG), focusing on generating text in human languages from
   non-linguistic data, which is of vital importance to achieve the
   interaction without barriers between human and other smart objects in
   SIoT. However, the existing solutions for data-to-text transformation
   rely on the specific template and standard neural networks models, which
   are not flexible when applying to the cross-domain data with diverse
   meaning. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called pipeline
   assisted neural networks (PAN), which integrates the traditional
   pipeline modules and neural generation systems, to conduct data-to-text
   generation tasks in SIoT. Our new PAN model makes use of attention
   module and gate mechanism to complete content selection, by analyzing
   records correlation and filtering redundant records. Then, a dedicated
   neural network is developed for salient span selection, pointing and
   transition to achieve content planning. In the end, we conduct
   experiments on the ROTOWIRE dataset to evaluate the performance of PAN.
   The results demonstrate that our proposed PAN model outperforms the
   existing solutions. (C) 2020 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

  abstract        = {Unsupervised textual anomaly detection, which discovers anomalies from
   unlabeled texts, is critical to improve the cybersecurity and
   interaction ability among the objects in the Social Internet of Things
   (SIoT). Recently, detecting anomalies by deep neural networks has become
   a popular trend. Specially, context vector data description (CVDD)
   method shows the promising performance. However, CVDD has two
   limitations: (1) it uses an one-class classification objective to
   constrain the sentence embeddings, which leads the learned embeddings to
   lose content information of text. (2) Scalar-based attention weights,
   which are used to extract sentence features, fail to focus on
   dimensional properties in a word. Learning the text contents and the
   dimensional properties is important for detection task in SIoT, which
   can help detector capture the difference between normal and anomaly
   texts. To overcome these limits, this paper proposes a textual anomaly
   detection network. First, an adversarial training strategy is designed
   to fight against the problem of missing content information. Second, a
   textual anomaly detection module with multiple dimensional
   transformation matrices is constructed to learn dimensional properties
   of words in diverse semantic subspaces. Experimental results on several
   textual datasets show that our proposed method outperforms CVDD and
   other strong baselines.},

   principles are needed to ensure safe communication in the network. From
   this perspective, various Trust Management models have been set forward
   in the literature in order to assess nodes trustworthiness and therefore
   to avoid malicious connections in the SIoT network. However, these
   models still lack practical solutions to address SIoT trust related
   attacks performed towards the trust evaluation process. In this regard,
   the present work stands for an in-depth study on the effectiveness of
   the trust attack management, as it is integrated into the trust model,
   with the aim of classifying the nodes behaviors more accurately in order
   to ensure secure connections in the network. For this reason, nodes
   behaviors analysis, based on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, is
   carried out within our trust assessment process. Our objective lies in
   limiting interactions with not only poor service provider, but also with
   attacker nodes. The proposed trust method's acquired outcome reveals
   that our introduced TM model demonstrates an improved efficiency in
   identifying malicious nodes compared to a trust classification algorithm
   without nodes behaviors evaluation. Experimentation conducted within a

   issue. To solve this issue, we propose a heuristic learning intrusion
   detection system with Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for edge-based SIoT networks
   under the scenario of insufficient training samples, which is named
   DQN-HIDS. It is composed of an SIoT network traffic processing module
   and a DQN-based heuristic learning network. The SIoT network traffic
   processing module generates SIoT traffic samples, selects samples
   entering a classifier and a cybersecurity examiner center, and outputs
   similarity. We integrate DQN into a heuristic learning network to
   gradually improve its ability to identify malicious traffic. Specially,
   reward functions are designed according to the selected actions of the
   network, in order to punish the behavior of incorrectly labeling
   malicious samples and make variable reward functions adapt to different
   execution actions. The LSTM-based DQN then maximizes the cumulative
   expected reward to find the optimal strategy for the heuristic learning
   network. Consequently, DQN-HIDS gradually improves the behavior
   frequency of its labeling, reduces resource workloads, and increases the
   ability to label SIoT network traffic. Experiments show the performance
   of DQN-HIDS in terms of the workload of the examiner center and the
   queue workload of delayed samples, the rewards obtained by the DQN-based
   heuristic learning network, and the accuracy of the classifier.
   Comparisons with a state-of-the-art deep learning model and typical

   in a certain sense can substitute for manually defined features at the
   sentence and field level. The GA layer can measure the relationships
   between sentences (or fields) and user requirements, which further helps

   development of increasingly advanced solutions for real-time management
   of collected information related to the management and coexistence of
   vehicles (i.e., buses, cars, trains, bicycles, etc.) immersed in urban
   and sub-urban traffic. The Social IoT (SIoT) paradigm adds a relational
   connotation between objects typical of human relationships. Objects
   operate as equals and request/provide information among them in the
   perspective of providing IoT services to users while maintaining their
   individuality. Social object relationship enables the design of
   solutions aiming to improve the exchange of information among network
   nodes in terms of security from malicious attacks external to the
   so-called social network of objects. In this context, a new SIoT smart
   city solution is presented in this article: private and public vehicles
   together with pedestrians are involved in a real-time collection of data
   to improve the viability of the city in order to suggest new directions
   and information to citizens to better organize how to live the city. The
   developed architecture presented in this article is equipped with an
   artificial intelligence that process collected traffic data and, thanks
   to machine learning techniques, evaluate the directions and flows
   undertaken by vehicles and pedestrians on a daily basis. The authors are
   also presenting an application that allow both citizens to live the city
   in a better way and municipal authorities to promptly manage traffic
   flows. The proposed system was installed in a specific area of Cagliari
   (Italy) and the traffic flows have been compared with daily traffic data
   monitored before the installation, observing an average gain of up to 35
   percent in daily traffic reduction.},
