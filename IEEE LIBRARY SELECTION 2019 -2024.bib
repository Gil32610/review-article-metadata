  abstract     = {Recently, smart cities, smart homes, and smart medical systems have challenged the functionality and connectivity of the large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Thus, with the idea of offloading intensive computing tasks from them to edge nodes (ENs), edge computing emerged to supplement these limited devices. Benefit from this advantage, IoT devices can save more energy and still maintain the quality of the services they should provide. However, computational offload decisions involve federation and complex resource management and should be determined in the real-time face to dynamic workloads and radio environments. Therefore, in this work, we use multiple deep reinforcement learning (DRL) agents deployed on multiple edge nodes to indicate the decisions of the IoT devices. On the other hand, with the aim of making DRL-based decisions feasible and further reducing the transmission costs between the IoT devices and edge nodes, federated learning (FL) is used to train DRL agents in a distributed fashion. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the decision scheme and federated learning in the dynamic IoT system.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning is an emerging machine learning technique that enables distributed model training using local datasets from large-scale nodes, e.g., mobile devices, but shares only model updates without uploading the raw training data. This technique provides a promising privacy preservation for mobile devices while simultaneously ensuring high learning performance. The majority of existing work has focused on designing advanced learning algorithms with an aim to achieve better learning performance. However, the challenges, such as incentive mechanisms for participating in training and worker (i.e., mobile devices) selection schemes for reliable federated learning, have not been explored yet. These challenges have hindered the widespread adoption of federated learning. To address the above challenges, in this article, we first introduce reputation as the metric to measure the reliability and trustworthiness of the mobile devices. We then design a reputation-based worker selection scheme for reliable federated learning by using a multiweight subjective logic model. We also leverage the blockchain to achieve secure reputation management for workers with nonrepudiation and tamper-resistance properties in a decentralized manner. Moreover, we propose an effective incentive mechanism combining reputation with contract theory to motivate high-reputation mobile devices with high-quality data to participate in model learning. Numerical results clearly indicate that the proposed schemes are efficient for reliable federated learning in terms of significantly improving the learning accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is emerging as a new paradigm to train machine learning (ML) models in distributed systems. Rather than sharing and disclosing the training data set with the server, the model parameters (e.g., neural networks' weights and biases) are optimized collectively by large populations of interconnected devices, acting as local learners. FL can be applied to power-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) devices with slow and sporadic connections. In addition, it does not need data to be exported to third parties, preserving privacy. Despite these benefits, a main limit of existing approaches is the centralized optimization which relies on a server for aggregation and fusion of local parameters; this has the drawback of a single point of failure and scaling issues for increasing network size. This article proposes a fully distributed (or serverless) learning approach: the proposed FL algorithms leverage the cooperation of devices that perform data operations inside the network by iterating local computations and mutual interactions via consensus-based methods. The approach lays the groundwork for integration of FL within 5G and beyond networks characterized by decentralized connectivity and computing, with intelligence distributed over the end devices. The proposed methodology is verified by the experimental data sets collected inside an Industrial IoT (IIoT) environment.},

The easily changed behaviors of edge infrastructure that software-defined networking (SDN) provides makes it possible to collate IoT data at edge servers and gateways, where federated learning (FL) can be performed: building a central model without uploading data to the server. FedAvg is an FL algorithm which has been the subject of much study, however, it suffers from a large number of rounds to convergence with non-independent identically distributed (non-IID) client data sets and high communication costs per round. We propose adapting FedAvg to use a distributed form of Adam optimization, greatly reducing the number of rounds to convergence, along with the novel compression techniques, to produce communication-efficient FedAvg (CE-FedAvg). We perform extensive experiments with the MNIST/CIFAR-10 data sets, IID/non-IID client data, varying numbers of clients, client participation rates, and compression rates. These show that CE-FedAvg can converge to a target accuracy in up to 6× less rounds than similarly compressed FedAvg, while uploading up to 3× less data, and is more robust to aggressive compression. Experiments on an edge-computing-like testbed using Raspberry Pi clients also show that CE-FedAvg is able to reach a target accuracy in up to 1.7× less real time than FedAvg.},

In this paper, we advocate a personalized federated learning framework in a cloud-edge architecture for intelligent IoT applications. To cope with the heterogeneity issues in IoT environments, we investigate emerging personalized federated learning methods which are able to mitigate the negative effects caused by heterogeneities in different aspects. With the power of edge computing, the requirements for fast-processing capacity and low latency in intelligent IoT applications can also be achieved.

This framework is empowered by public data center, private data center, and the blockchain technology. The private data center is responsible for data governance, data registration, and data management. The public data center is used for multiparty secure computation.

However, most current optimization-based methods lack a self-adaptive ability in dynamic environments. To tackle these challenges, current learning-based approaches are generally proposed in a centralized way. However, network resources may be overconsumed during the training and data transmission process. To address the complex and dynamic control issues, we propose a federated deep-reinforcement-learning-based cooperative edge caching (FADE) framework. FADE enables base stations (BSs) to cooperatively learn a shared predictive model by considering the first-round training parameters of the BSs as the initial input of the local training, and then uploads near-optimal local parameters to the BSs to participate in the next round of global training. Furthermore, we prove the expectation convergence of FADE. Trace-driven simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed FADE framework on reducing the performance loss and average delay, offloading backhaul traffic, and improving the hit rate.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning is an emerging concept that trains the machine learning models with the local distributed data sets, without sending the raw data to the data center. But, in the Internet of Things (IoT) where the wireless network resource is constrained, the key problem of federated learning is the communication overhead for parameter synchronization, which wastes bandwidth, increases training time, and even impacts the model accuracy. Gradient sparsification has received increasing attention, which only updates significant gradients and accumulates insignificant gradients locally. However, how to preserve the accuracy after a high ratio sparsification has been ignored in the literature. In this article, a general gradient sparsification (GGS) framework is proposed for adaptive optimizers, to correct the sparse gradient update process. It consists of two important mechanisms: 1) gradient correction and 2) batch normalization (BN) update with local gradients. With gradient correction, the optimizer can properly treat the accumulated insignificant gradients, which makes the model converge better. Furthermore, updating the BN layer with local gradients can relieve the impact of delayed gradients without increasing the communication overhead. We have conducted experiments on LeNet-5, CifarNet, DenseNet-121, and AlexNet with adaptive optimizers. Results show that when 99.9% gradients are sparsified, validation data sets are maintained with top-1 accuracy.},

We consider a hybrid architecture (cloud-MEC) for the distributed learning, which is also known as “federated learning” as one of the practical examples, where a coordinator at the cloud coordinates IoT sensors to efficiently distribute their sensing data over multiple MECs. In this sense, multiple MECs receive a shared model from the coordinator and conduct local training of received partial sensing data from IoT sensors. Then, the coordinator at the cloud merges returned local training results from MECs and generates a global model. To model a hierarchical decision-making structure as a market behavior, we formulate and solve a Stackelberg game model. Specifically, in the case of MEC operators as leaders, we design a pricing scheme for MEC operators to obtain its maximum utility by considering a tradeoff between the revenue and energy consumption. Then, as a follower, while the coordinator aims at achieving a balance between the satisfaction attained from the distributed learning and the costs, it follows the MEC operators' decisions by coordinating IoT sensors to distribute their sensing data over MECs. A unique Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) point is given as a closed form. Finally, we reveal that the SE solution maximizes the utility of all market participants. This game-theoretic study demonstrates that there is an incentive for utilizing multiple MECs to achieve better satisfaction of IoT services in distributed learning.},

However, further adoption of centralized machine learning in industries seems to be restricted due to data privacy issues. Federated learning has the potential to bring about predictive features in industrial systems without leaking private information. However, its implementation involves key challenges including resource optimization, robustness, and security. In this article, we propose a novel dispersed federated learning (DFL) framework to provide resource optimization, whereby distributed fashion of learning offers robustness. We formulate an integer linear optimization problem to minimize the overall federated learning cost for the DFL framework. To solve the formulated problem, first, we decompose it into two sub-problems: association and resource allocation problem. Second, we relax the association and resource allocation sub-problems to make them convex optimization problems. Later, we use the rounding technique to obtain binary association and resource allocation variables. Our proposed algorithm works in an iterative manner by fixing one problem variable (for example, association) and compute the other (for example, resource allocation). The iterative algorithm continues until convergence of the formulated cost optimization problem. Furthermore, we compare the proposed DFL with two schemes; namely, random resource allocation and random association. Numerical results show the superiority of the proposed DFL scheme.},

To materialize such a vision which is known as edge intelligence, federated learning is emerging as a promising solution to enable edge nodes to collaboratively learn a shared model in a privacy-preserving and communication-efficient manner, by keeping the data at the edge nodes. While pilot efforts on federated learning have mostly focused on reducing the communication overhead, the computation efficiency of those resource-constrained edge nodes has been largely overlooked. To bridge this gap, in this article, we investigate how to coordinate the edge and the cloud to optimize the system-wide cost efficiency of federated learning. Leveraging the Lyapunov optimization theory, we design and analyze a cost-efficient optimization framework CEFL to make online yet near-optimal control decisions on admission control, load balancing, data scheduling, and accuracy tuning for the dynamically arrived training data samples, reducing both computation and communication cost. In particular, our control framework CEFL can be flexibly extended to incorporate various design choices and practical requirements of federated learning, such as exploiting the cheaper cloud resource for model training with better cost efficiency yet still facilitating on-demand privacy preservation. Via both rigorous theoretical analysis and extensive trace-driven evaluations, we verify the cost efficiency of our proposed CEFL framework.},

Machine learning models are often built on these data, to enable the detection, classification, and prediction of the future events. Due to network bandwidth, storage, and especially privacy concerns, it is often impossible to send all the IoT data to the data center for centralized model training. To address these issues, federated learning has been proposed to let nodes use the local data to train models, which are then aggregated to synthesize a global model. Most of the existing work has focused on designing learning algorithms with provable convergence time, but other issues, such as incentive mechanism, are unexplored. Although incentive mechanisms have been extensively studied in network and computation resource allocation, yet they cannot be applied to federated learning directly due to the unique challenges of information unsharing and difficulties of contribution evaluation. In this article, we study the incentive mechanism for federated learning to motivate edge nodes to contribute model training. Specifically, a deep reinforcement learning-based (DRL) incentive mechanism has been designed to determine the optimal pricing strategy for the parameter server and the optimal training strategies for edge nodes. Finally, numerical experiments have been implemented to evaluate the efficiency of the proposed DRL-based incentive mechanism.},

In this paper, we analyze the impact of 5G on both traditional and emerging technologies and project our view on future research challenges and opportunities. With a predicted increase of 10-100× in bandwidth and 5-10x decrease in latency, 5G is expected to be the main enabler for smart cities, smart IoT and efficient healthcare, where machine learning is conducted at the edge. In this context, we investigate how 5G can help the development of federated learning. Network slicing, another key feature of 5G, allows running multiple isolated networks on the same physical infrastructure. However, security remains the main concern in the context of virtualization, multi-tenancy and high device density. Formal verification of 5G networks can be applied to detect security issues in massive virtualized environments. In summary, 5G will make the world even more densely and closely connected. What we have experienced in 4G connectivity will pale in comparison to the vast amounts of possibilities engendered by 5G.},

  abstract     = {Thanks to the advances in wireless communication and machine learning technologies, we can envision a novel AIoT (AI + IoT) service platform that collects video data from the individuals' edge devices. Then, it transforms the video data into useful information, providing services to IoT or smart city applications. However, collecting raw video data directly to the cloud server is merely possible due to network bandwidth limitations and data privacy concerns. One possible solution is to adopt federated learning, which enables edge devices to collaboratively train a shared model without sending the raw data to the cloud. Unfortunately, this scheme cannot directly be applied to the targeted scenario since it assumes labeled data for training, and only at the cloud, we have the human power and time to label the video data. Thus, to tackle those issues, we propose an edge learning system based on semisupervised learning and federated learning technologies. The system trains AI models at edge devices using an improved semisupervised learning scheme and periodically uploads the training results to the cloud server to form a single model by adapting the federated learning technology. Then, we observe that in the real world, the data on the end devices are nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) such that it may cause weight divergence during training and result in a considerable decrease in the model performance. Therefore, we propose a new operation called federated swapping (FedSwap) to replace partial federated learning operations based on a few shared data during federated training to alleviate the adverse impact of weight divergence. We evaluate our system on both image classification using the state-of-the-art benchmark data and object detection using real-world video data. The experimental results show that the proposed system can have up to 5.9% higher accuracy of object detection for the video analysis applications by fully utilizing unlabeled data, compared with the situation that only labeled data are used. Moreover, the proposed FedSwap can improve the accuracy of image classification by 3.8% and the object detection task by 1.1%.},

The majority of existing works hardly consider a reasonable balance between them while suffering from poisoning attacks. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel blockchain-enabled federated learning (FL-Block) scheme to close the gap. FL-Block allows local learning updates of end devices exchanges with a blockchain-based global learning model, which is verified by miners. Built upon this, FL-Block enables the autonomous machine learning without any centralized authority to maintain the global model and coordinates by using a Proof-of-Work consensus mechanism of the blockchain. Furthermore, we analyze the latency performance of FL-Block and further derive the optimal block generation rate by taking communication, consensus delays, and computation cost into consideration. Extensive evaluation results show the superior performances of FL-Block from the aspects of privacy protection, efficiency, and resistance to the poisoning attack.},

However, these data sets may contain lots of user's private data, which is challenging the current prediction approaches as user privacy is calling for the public concern in recent years. Therefore, how to develop accurate traffic prediction while preserving privacy is a significant problem to be solved, and there is a tradeoff between these two objectives. To address this challenge, we introduce a privacy-preserving machine learning technique named federated learning (FL) and propose an FL-based gated recurrent unit neural network algorithm (FedGRU) for traffic flow prediction (TFP). FedGRU differs from current centralized learning methods and updates universal learning models through a secure parameter aggregation mechanism rather than directly sharing raw data among organizations. In the secure parameter aggregation mechanism, we adopt a federated averaging algorithm to reduce the communication overhead during the model parameter transmission process. Furthermore, we design a joint announcement protocol to improve the scalability of FedGRU. We also propose an ensemble clustering-based scheme for TFP by grouping the organizations into clusters before applying the FedGRU algorithm. Extensive case studies on a real-world data set demonstrate that FedGRU can produce predictions that are merely 0.76 km/h worse than the state of the art in terms of mean average error under the privacy preservation constraint, confirming that the proposed model develops accurate traffic predictions without compromising the data privacy.},

  abstract     = {Emerging mobile edge techniques and applications such as Augmented Reality (AR)/Virtual Reality (VR), Internet of Things (IoT), and vehicle networking, result in an explosive growth of power and computing resource consumptions. In the meantime, the volume of data generated at the edge networks is also increasing rapidly. Under this circumstance, building energy-efficient and privacy-protected communications is imperative for 5G and beyond wireless communication systems. The recent emerging distributed learning methods such as federated learning (FL) perform well in improving resource efficiency while protecting user privacy with low communication overhead. Specifically, FL enables edge devices to learn a shared network model by aggregating local updates while keeping all the training processes on local devices. This paper investigates distributed power allocation for edge users in decentralized wireless networks with aim to maximize energy/spectrum efficiency while preventing privacy leakage based on a FL framework. Due to the dynamics and complexity of wireless networks, we adopt an on-line Actor-Critic (AC) architecture as the local training model, and FL performs cooperation for edge users by sharing the gradients and weightages generated in the Actor network. Moreover, in order to resolve the over-fitting problem caused by data leakages in Non-independent and identically distributed (Non-i.i.d) data environment, we propose a federated augmentation mechanism with Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks (WGANs) algorithm for data augmentation. Federated augmentation empowers each device to replenish the data buffer using a generative model of WGANs until accomplishing an i.i.d training dataset, which significantly reduces the communication overhead in distributed learning compared to direct data sample exchange method. Numerical results reveal that the proposed federated learning based cooperation and augmentation (FL-CA) algorithm possesses a good convergence property, high robustness and achieves better accuracy of power allocation strategy than other three benchmark algorithms.},

According to the fact that underwater networks are relatively not easy to set up reliable links by huge fading compared to wireless free-space air medium, gathering all training data for conducting centralized deep learning training is not easy. Therefore, FL-based distributed deep learning can be a suitable solution for this application. In this IoUT network (IoUT-Net) scenario, the FL system needs to construct a global learning model by aggregating the local model parameters that are obtained from individual IoUT devices. In order to reliably deliver the parameters from IoUT devices to a centralized FL machine, base station like devices are needed. Therefore, a joint cell association and resource allocation (JCARA) method is required and it is designed inspired by multiagent deep deterministic policy gradient (MADDPG) to deal with distributed situations and unexpected time-varying states. The performance evaluation results show that our proposed MADDPG-based algorithm achieves 80% and 41% performance improvements than the standard actor–critic and DDPG, respectively, in terms of the downlink throughput.},

In mobile crowdsensing, a model owner announces a sensing task following which interested workers collect the required data. However, in some cases, a model owner may have insufficient data samples to build an effective machine learning model. To this end, we propose a federated learning (FL)-based privacy-preserving approach to facilitate collaborative machine learning among multiple model owners in mobile crowdsensing. Our system model allows collaborative machine learning without compromising data privacy given that only the model parameters instead of the raw data are exchanged within the federation. However, there are two main challenges of incentive mismatches between workers and model owners, as well as among model owners. For the former, we leverage on the self-revealing mechanism in the contract theory under information asymmetry. For the latter, to ensure the stability of a federation through preventing free-riding attacks, we use the coalitional game theory approach that rewards model owners based on their marginal contributions. Considering the inherent hierarchical structure of the involved entities, we propose a hierarchical incentive mechanism framework. Using the backward induction, we first solve the contract formulation and then proceed to solve the coalitional game with the merge and split algorithm. The numerical results validate the performance efficiency of our proposed hierarchical incentive mechanism design, in terms of incentive compatibility of our contract design and fair payoffs of model owners in stable federation formation.},

For IoHT data to be acceptable by stakeholders, applications that incorporate the IoHT must have a provision for data provenance, in addition to the accuracy, security, integrity, and quality of data. To protect the privacy and security of IoHT data, federated learning (FL) and differential privacy (DP) have been proposed, where private IoHT data can be trained at the owner’s premises. Recent advancements in hardware GPUs even allow the FL process within smartphone or edge devices having the IoHT attached to their edge nodes. Although some of the privacy concerns of IoHT data are addressed by FL, fully decentralized FL is still a challenge due to the lack of training capability at all federated nodes, the scarcity of high-quality training datasets, the provenance of training data, and the authentication required for each FL node. In this paper, we present a lightweight hybrid FL framework in which blockchain smart contracts manage the edge training plan, trust management, and authentication of participating federated nodes, the distribution of global or locally trained models, the reputation of edge nodes and their uploaded datasets or models. The framework also supports the full encryption of a dataset, the model training, and the inferencing process. Each federated edge node performs additive encryption, while the blockchain uses multiplicative encryption to aggregate the updated model parameters. To support the full privacy and anonymization of the IoHT data, the framework supports lightweight DP. This framework was tested with several deep learning applications designed for clinical trials with COVID-19 patients. We present here the detailed design, implementation, and test results, which demonstrate strong potential for wider adoption of IoHT-based health management in a secure way.},

In the big data era, one of the most critical applications is multiparty learning or federated learning, which allows different parties to collaborate with each other to obtain better learning models without sharing their own data. However, there are several main concerns about the current multiparty learning systems. First, most existing systems are distributed and need a central server to coordinate the learning process. However, such a central server can easily become a single point of failure and may not be trustworthy. Second, although quite a few schemes have been proposed to study Byzantine attacks, a very common and challenging kind of attack in distributed systems, they generally consider the scenario of learning a global model. However, in fact, all parties in multiparty learning usually have their own local models. The learning methods and security issues, in this case, are not fully explored. In this article, we propose a novel blockchain-empowered decentralized secure multiparty learning system with heterogeneous local models called BEMA. Particularly, we consider two types of Byzantine attacks, and carefully design “off-chain sample mining” and “on-chain mining ” schemes to protect the security of the proposed system. We theoretically prove the system performance bound and resilience under Byzantine attacks. The simulation results show that the proposed system obtains comparable performance with that of conventional distributed systems, and bounded performance in the case of Byzantine attacks.},

  abstract     = {Emerging applications of machine learning in numerous areas-including online social networks, remote sensing, Internet-of-Things (IoT) systems, smart grids, and more-involve continuous gathering of and learning from streams of data samples. Real-time incorporation of streaming data into the learned machine learning models is essential for improved inference in these applications. Furthermore, these applications often involve data that are either inherently gathered at geographically distributed entities due to physical reasons, for example, IoT systems and smart grids, or that are intentionally distributed across multiple computing machines for memory, storage, computational, and/or privacy reasons. Training of machine learning models in this distributed, streaming setting requires solving stochastic optimization (SO) problems in a collaborative manner over communication links between the physical entities. When the streaming data rate is high compared with the processing capabilities of individual computing entities and/or the rate of the communications links, this poses a challenging question: How can one best leverage the incoming data for distributed training of machine learning models under constraints on computing capabilities and/or communications rate? A large body of research in distributed online optimization has emerged in recent decades to tackle this and related problems. This article reviews recently developed methods that focus on large-scale distributed SO in the compute- and bandwidth-limited regimes, with an emphasis on convergence analysis that explicitly accounts for the mismatch between computation, communication, and streaming rates and provides sufficient conditions for order-optimum convergence. In particular, it focuses on methods that solve: 1) distributed stochastic convex problems and 2) distributed principal component analysis, which is a nonconvex problem with the geometric structure that permits global convergence. For such methods, this article discusses recent advances in terms of distributed algorithmic designs when faced with high-rate streaming data. Furthermore, it reviews theoretical guarantees underlying these methods that show that there exist regimes in which systems can learn from distributed processing of streaming data at order-optimal rates-nearly as fast as if all the data were processed at a single superpowerful machine.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is penetrating many facets of our daily life with the proliferation of intelligent services and applications empowered by artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques require centralized data collection and processing that may not be feasible in realistic application scenarios due to the high scalability of modern IoT networks and growing data privacy concerns. Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a distributed collaborative AI approach that can enable many intelligent IoT applications, by allowing for AI training at distributed IoT devices without the need for data sharing. In this article, we provide a comprehensive survey of the emerging applications of FL in IoT networks, beginning from an introduction to the recent advances in FL and IoT to a discussion of their integration. Particularly, we explore and analyze the potential of FL for enabling a wide range of IoT services, including IoT data sharing, data offloading and caching, attack detection, localization, mobile crowdsensing, and IoT privacy and security. We then provide an extensive survey of the use of FL in various key IoT applications such as smart healthcare, smart transportation, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs), smart cities, and smart industry. The important lessons learned from this review of the FL-IoT services and applications are also highlighted. We complete this survey by highlighting the current challenges and possible directions for future research in this booming area.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) will be ripe for the deployment of novel machine learning algorithm for both network and application management. However, given the presence of massively distributed and private datasets, it is challenging to use classical centralized learning algorithms in the IoT. To overcome this challenge, federated learning can be a promising solution that enables on-device machine learning without the need to migrate the private end-user data to a central cloud. In federated learning, only learning model updates are transferred between end-devices and the aggregation server. Although federated learning can offer better privacy preservation than centralized machine learning, it has still privacy concerns. In this paper, first, we present the recent advances of federated learning towards enabling federated learning-powered IoT applications. A set of metrics such as sparsification, robustness, quantization, scalability, security, and privacy, is delineated in order to rigorously evaluate the recent advances. Second, we devise a taxonomy for federated learning over IoT networks. Finally, we present several open research challenges with their possible solutions.},

To ease the communication burden in IoT systems, several approaches have been proposed for the FL tasks, including sparsification methods and data quantization strategies. To overcome the shortcomings of the existing methods, we propose two new FL algorithms based on compressed sensing (CS) referred to as the CS-FL algorithm and the 1-bit CS-FL algorithm, both of which compress the upstream and downstream data while communicating between the clients and the central server. The proposed algorithms improve upon the existing algorithms by letting the clients send analog and 1-bit data, respectively, to the server after compression with a random measurement matrix. Based on that, in CS-FL and 1-bit CS-FL, the clients update the model locally utilizing the result of sparse reconstruction obtained by iterative hard thresholding (IHT) and binary IHT (BIHT), respectively. Experiments conducted on the MNIST and the Fashion-MNIST data sets reveal the superiority of the proposed algorithm over the baseline algorithms, SignSGD with a majority vote, FL based on sparse ternary compression, and FedAvg.},

Due to 5G/6G is based on new radio (NR) technology, the multiple-input and multiple-output (MIMO) of radio services for heterogeneous IoT devices have been performed. The autonomous resource allocation and the intelligent quality of service class identity (IQCI) in mobile networks based on FL systems are obligated to meet the requirements of privacy constraints of IoT applications. In massive FL communications, the heterogeneous local devices propagate their local models and parameters over 5G/6G networks to the aggregation servers in edge cloud areas. Therefore, the assurance of network reliability is compulsory to facilitate end-to-end (E2E) reliability of FL communications and provide the satisfaction of model decisions. This paper proposed an intelligent lightweight scheme based on the reference software-defined networking (SDN) architecture to handle the massive FL communications between clients and aggregators to meet the mentioned perspectives. The handling method adjusts the model parameters and batches size of the individual client to reflect the apparent network conditions classified by the k-nearest neighbor (KNN) algorithm.

We formulate the joint optimization of CPU and power control as a nonlinear programming (NLP) problem with the objective to minimize the energy consumption of all IoT devices constrained by the federated learning time requirement. An alternative direction algorithm, which alternatively optimizes the CPU frequency and wireless transmission power until convergence, is hence designed to solve this problem and its performance is demonstrated via extensive simulations.},

  abstract     = {The deployment of relays between Internet of Things (IoT) end devices and gateways can improve link quality. In cellular-based IoT, relays have the potential to reduce base station overload. The energy expended in single-hop long-range communication can be reduced if relays listen to transmissions of end devices and forward these observations to gateways. However, incorporating relays into IoT networks faces some challenges. IoT end devices are designed primarily for uplink communication of small-sized observations toward the network; hence, opportunistically using end devices as relays needs a redesign of both the medium access control (MAC) layer protocol of such end devices and possible addition of new communication interfaces. Additionally, the wake-up time of IoT end devices needs to be synchronized with that of the relays. For cellular-based IoT, the possibility of using infrastructure relays exists, and noncellular IoT networks can leverage the presence of mobile devices for relaying, for example, in remote healthcare. However, the latter presents problems of incentivizing relay participation and managing the mobility of relays. Furthermore, although relays can increase the lifetime of IoT networks, deploying relays implies the need for additional batteries to power them. This can erode the energy efficiency gain that relays offer. Therefore, designing relay-assisted IoT networks that provide acceptable trade-offs is key, and this goes beyond adding an extra transmit RF chain to a relay-enabled IoT end device. There has been increasing research interest in IoT relaying, as demonstrated in the available literature. Works that consider these issues are surveyed in this paper to provide insight into the state of the art, provide design insights for network designers and motivate future research directions.},

To effectively fuse and process the tremendous amount of IoT sensing data timely, there is an urgent need to shift from a conventional centralized computing to a decentralized computing. However, there remain some essential technical challenges to develop effective decentralized computing methods in the context of IoT applications, including 1) the timely response, sufficient privacy preservation, and high security are normally required in IoT-related applications and 2) the biases and non-independent identically distributed (IID) properties potentially presented in the IoT sensing data. To address these challenges, in this article, we propose a decentralized deep learning paradigm with privacy-preservation and fast few-shot learning (DDLPF) by exploiting federated learning, metalearning, and blockchain techniques. In the simulation section, we evaluate the performance of our proposed DDLPF paradigm in different scenarios and compare it with other existing techniques.},

Machine learning (ML) models with big IoT data is beneficial to our daily life in monitoring air condition, pollution, climate change, etc. However, centralized conventional ML models rely on all clients’ data at a central server, which seriously threatens user privacy. Federated learning (FL) emerges as a promising solution aiming to protect user privacy by enabling model training on a large corpus of decentralized data. The recent studies indicate FL suffers from the heterogeneity issue as it treats all clients’ data equally, that is, FL might sacrifice the performance of the majority of clients to accommodate the performance of the minority of clients with low usability data. In order to overcome this issue, a reinforcement learning (RL)-based intelligent central server with the capability of recognizing heterogeneity is implemented, which can help lead the trend toward better performance for majority of clients. To be specific, an FL central server analyses the benefits of different collaboration by capturing the intricate patterns in heterogeneous clients based on rating feedback and then updates clients’ weights iteratively, until it establishes a coalition of clients with quasioptimal performance. The experimental results on three real data sets under various heterogeneity levels demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed solution.},

Federated learning (FL) recently emerges as a promising technique to accommodate these concerns, by means of learning a global model by aggregating local updates from multiple devices without sharing the privacy-sensitive data. However, IoT devices usually have constrained computation resources and poor network connections, making it infeasible or very slow to train deep neural networks (DNNs) by following the FL pattern. To address this problem, we propose a new efficient FL framework called FL-PQSU in this paper. It is composed of 3-stage pipeline: structured pruning, weight quantization and selective updating, that work together to reduce the costs of computation, storage, and communication to accelerate the FL training process. We study FL-PQSU using popular DNN models (AlexNet, VGG16) and publicly available datasets (MNIST, CIFAR10), and demonstrate that it can well control the training overhead while still guaranteeing the learning performance.},

These techniques, however, suffer from privacy and security concerns since data are collected from clients and then stored and processed at a central location. Federated learning (FL), an architecture in which model parameters are exchanged instead of client data, has been proposed as a solution to these concerns. Nevertheless, FL trains a global model by communicating with clients over communication rounds, which introduces more traffic on the network and increases the convergence time to the target accuracy. In this work, we solve the problem of optimizing accuracy in stateful FL with a budgeted number of candidate clients by selecting the best candidate clients in terms of test accuracy to participate in the training process. Next, we propose an online stateful FL heuristic to find the best candidate clients. Additionally, we propose an IoT client alarm application that utilizes the proposed heuristic in training a stateful FL global model based on IoT device-type classification to alert clients about unauthorized IoT devices in their environment. To test the efficiency of the proposed online heuristic, we conduct several experiments using a real data set and compare the results against state-of-the-art algorithms. Our results indicate that the proposed heuristic outperforms the online random algorithm with up to 27% gain in accuracy. Additionally, the performance of the proposed online heuristic is comparable to the performance of the best offline algorithm.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Vehicles (IoV) is a promising branch of the Internet of Things. IoV simulates a large variety of crowdsourcing applications, such as Waze, Uber, and Amazon Mechanical Turk, etc. Users of these applications report the real-time traffic information to the cloud server which trains a machine learning model based on traffic information reported by users for intelligent traffic management. However, crowdsourcing application owners can easily infer users' location information, traffic information, motor vehicle information, environmental information, etc., which raises severe sensitive personal information privacy concerns of the users. In addition, as the number of vehicles increases, the frequent communication between vehicles and the cloud server incurs unexpected amount of communication cost. To avoid the privacy threat and reduce the communication cost, in this article, we propose to integrate federated learning and local differential privacy (LDP) to facilitate the crowdsourcing applications to achieve the machine learning model. Specifically, we propose four LDP mechanisms to perturb gradients generated by vehicles. The proposed Three-Outputs mechanism introduces three different output possibilities to deliver a high accuracy when the privacy budget is small. The output possibilities of Three-Outputs can be encoded with two bits to reduce the communication cost. Besides, to maximize the performance when the privacy budget is large, an optimal piecewise mechanism (PM-OPT) is proposed. We further propose a suboptimal mechanism (PM-SUB) with a simple formula and comparable utility to PM-OPT. Then, we build a novel hybrid mechanism by combining Three-Outputs and PM-SUB. Finally, an LDP-FedSGD algorithm is proposed to coordinate the cloud server and vehicles to train the model collaboratively. Extensive experimental results on real-world data sets validate that our proposed algorithms are capable of protecting privacy while guaranteeing utility.},

  abstract     = {The rise in popularity of Internet of Things (IoT) devices has attracted hackers to develop IoT-specific attacks. The microservice architecture of IoT devices relies on the Internet to provide their intended services. An unguarded IoT network makes inter-connected devices vulnerable to attacks. It will be a tedious and ineffective process to manually detect the attacks in the network, as the attackers frequently upgrade their attack strategies. Machine learning (ML)-assisted approaches have been proposed to build intrusion detection for cybersecurity automation in IoT networks. However, most such approaches focus on training an ML model using a single view of the dataset, which often fails to build insightful knowledge and understand each feature’s impact on the ML model’s decision-making ability. As such, the model training with a single view may result in an incomplete understanding of patterns in large feature-set datasets. Moreover, the current approaches are mainly designed in a centralized manner in which the raw data is transferred from the edge devices to the central server for training. This, in turn, may expose the data to all kinds of attacks without adhering to the privacy-preserving of data security. Multi-view learning has gained popularity for its ability to learn from different data views and deliver efficient performance with more distinguished predictions. This paper proposes a federated learning-based intrusion detection approach, called MV-FLID, that trains on multiple views of IoT network data in a decentralized format to detect, classify, and defend against attacks. The multi-view ensemble learning aspect helps in maximizing the learning efficiency of different classes of attacks. The Federated Learning (FL) aspect, wherein the device’s data is not shared to the server, performs profile aggregation efficiently with the benefit of peer learning. Our evaluation results show that our proposed approach has higher accuracy compared to the traditional non-FL centralized approach.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) allows multiple edge computing nodes to jointly build a shared learning model without having to transfer their raw data to a centralized server, thus reducing communication overhead. However, FL still faces a number of challenges such as nonindependent and identically distributed data and heterogeneity of user equipments (UEs). Enabling a large number of UEs to join the training process in every round raises a potential issue of the heavy global communication burden. To address these issues, we generalize the current state-of-the-art federated averaging (FedAvg) by adding a weight-based proximal term to the local loss function. The proposed FL algorithm runs stochastic gradient descent in parallel on a sampled subset of the total UEs with replacement during each global round. We provide a convergence upper bound characterizing the tradeoff between convergence rate and global rounds, showing that a small number of active UEs per round still guarantees convergence. Next, we employ the proposed FL algorithm in wireless Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks to minimize either total energy consumption or completion time of FL, where a simple yet efficient path-following algorithm is developed for its solutions. Finally, numerical results on unbalanced data sets are provided to demonstrate the performance improvement and robustness on the convergence rate of the proposed FL algorithm over FedAvg. They also reveal that the proposed algorithm requires much less training time and energy consumption than the FL algorithm with full user participation. These observations advocate the proposed FL algorithm for a paradigm shift in bandwidth-constrained learning wireless IoT networks.},

  abstract     = {This paper proposes a novel traffic monitoring framework, namely, DeepMonitor, for SDN-based IoT networks to provide fine-grained traffic analysis capability for different IoT traffic types at the network edges. Specifically, we first develop an intelligent flow rule match-field control system, called DeepMonitor agent, for SDN-based IoT edge nodes, taking different granularity-level requirements and their maximum flow-table capacity into consideration. We then formulate the control optimization problem for each edge node employing the Markov decision process (MDP). Next, we develop a double deep  ${Q}$ -network (DDQN) algorithm to quickly achieve the optimal flow rule match-field policy. Moreover, we propose a federated DDQN-based traffic monitoring mechanism to significantly improve the learning performance of the edge nodes. The results obtained through extensive emulations show that by applying the DeepMonitor, the flow-table overflow problem at the edge nodes can be completely bypassed. The average number of match-fields in a flow rule achieved by DeepMonitor is increased by approximately 37% (for medium and diverse granularity-level requirements) and 41.9% (for high granularity-level requirement) compared to that of an existing solution, i.e., FlowStat. Finally, by adopting DeepMonitor, the DDoS attack detection performance of an intrusion detection system can be enhanced by up to 22.83% compared with that of FlowStat.},

Furthermore, data collected by the edge device contain massive user's private data, which is challenging current detection approaches as user privacy has attracted more and more public concerns. With this focus, this article proposes a new communication-efficient on-device federated learning (FL)-based deep anomaly detection framework for sensing time-series data in IIoT. Specifically, we first introduce an FL framework to enable decentralized edge devices to collaboratively train an anomaly detection model, which can improve its generalization ability. Second, we propose an attention mechanism-based convolutional neural network-long short-term memory (AMCNN-LSTM) model to accurately detect anomalies. The AMCNN-LSTM model uses attention mechanism-based convolutional neural network units to capture important fine-grained features, thereby preventing memory loss and gradient dispersion problems. Furthermore, this model retains the advantages of the long short-term memory unit in predicting time-series data. Third, to adapt the proposed framework to the timeliness of industrial anomaly detection, we propose a gradient compression mechanism based on Top- k selection to improve communication efficiency. Extensive experimental studies on four real-world data sets demonstrate that our framework accurately and timely detects anomalies and also reduces the communication overhead by 50% compared to the FL framework that does not use the gradient compression scheme.},

The existing work in this direction mainly relies on models that are of less practical value for resource-limited IoT networks, and can hardly simulate the dynamic systems in real time. In this article, we integrate digital twins with edge networks and propose the digital twin edge networks (DITENs) to fill the gap between physical edge networks and digital systems.

  abstract     = {Mobile-edge computing (MEC) has been envisioned as a promising paradigm to handle the massive volume of data generated from ubiquitous mobile devices for enabling intelligent services with the help of artificial intelligence (AI). Traditionally, AI techniques often require centralized data collection and training in a single entity, e.g., an MEC server, which is now becoming a weak point due to data privacy concerns and high overhead of raw data communications. In this context, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to provide collaborative data training solutions, by coordinating multiple mobile devices to train a shared AI model without directly exposing their underlying data, which enjoys considerable privacy enhancement. To improve the security and scalability of FL implementation, blockchain as a ledger technology is attractive for realizing decentralized FL training without the need for any central server. Particularly, the integration of FL and blockchain leads to a new paradigm, called FLchain, which potentially transforms intelligent MEC networks into decentralized, secure, and privacy-enhancing systems. This article presents an overview of the fundamental concepts and explores the opportunities of FLchain in MEC networks. We identify several main issues in FLchain design, including communication cost, resource allocation, incentive mechanism, security and privacy protection. The key solutions and the lessons learned along with the outlooks are also discussed. Then, we investigate the applications of FLchain in popular MEC domains, such as edge data sharing, edge content caching and edge crowdsensing. Finally, important research challenges and future directions are also highlighted.},

To help manufacturers develop a smart home system, we design a federated learning (FL) system leveraging a reputation mechanism to assist home appliance manufacturers to train a machine learning model based on customers’ data. Then, manufacturers can predict customers’ requirements and consumption behaviors in the future. The working flow of the system includes two stages: in the first stage, customers train the initial model provided by the manufacturer using both the mobile phone and the mobile-edge computing (MEC) server. Customers collect data from various home appliances using phones, and then they download and train the initial model with their local data. After deriving local models, customers sign on their models and send them to the blockchain. In case customers or manufacturers are malicious, we use the blockchain to replace the centralized aggregator in the traditional FL system. Since records on the blockchain are untampered, malicious customers or manufacturers’ activities are traceable. In the second stage, manufacturers select customers or organizations as miners for calculating the averaged model using received models from customers. By the end of the crowdsourcing task, one of the miners, who is selected as the temporary leader, uploads the model to the blockchain. To protect customers’ privacy and improve the test accuracy, we enforce differential privacy (DP) on the extracted features and propose a new normalization technique. We experimentally demonstrate that our normalization technique outperforms batch normalization when features are under DP protection. In addition, to attract more customers to participate in the crowdsourcing FL task, we design an incentive mechanism to award participants.},

In order to solve the above problems, we introduce edge computing into the IIot, so that the device can complete the federated learning operation. In order to ensure the security of data transmission, blockchain is introduced as the main algorithm of equipment authentication in the system. What's more, in order to increase the efficiency and versatility of training model in IIoT, we introduce transfer learning to improve the system performance.

We also design a dynamic participant selection strategy tailored to the setting of large-scale FL, which accelerates the selection process of target participants and improves attack accuracy. We evaluate the proposed attack through extensive experiments with publicly available data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed attack is effective and efficient in inferring various properties of training data, while maintaining the high quality of the main tasks in FL.},

However, devices in IIoT systems are usually deployed densely; increasing the number of clients can potentially cause serious interference and prolonged training latency. In this article, we propose a resource allocation scheme for FL, namely RaFed. We formulate the problem of reducing training latency as an optimization problem, which is proved to be NP-hard. We propose a heuristic algorithm to select appropriate devices for achieving a good tradeoff between the interference and convergence time. We conduct experiments using an RGB-D dataset in an IIoT system. The results show that RaFed significantly reduces the latency by 29.9%, compared to the state-of-the-art works.},

While federated learning (FL) is a popular distributed learning approach, it suffers from communication overheads and high computational requirements. Moreover, global aggregation in FL relies on a centralized server, prone to malicious attacks, resulting in inefficient training models. We address these issues by introducing geospatially placed fog nodes into the FL framework as local aggregators. These fog nodes are responsible for defined demographics, which help share location-based information for applications with similar environments. Furthermore, we formulate a greedy heuristic approach for selecting an optimal fog node for assuming a global aggregator's role at each round of communication between the edge and cloud, thereby reducing the dependence on the execution at the centralized server. Fog nodes in the FogFL framework reduce communication latency and energy consumption of resource-constrained edge devices without affecting the global model's convergence rate, thereby increasing the system's reliability. Extensive deployment and experimental results corroborate that, in addition to a decrease in global aggregation rounds, FogFL reduces energy consumption and communication latency by 92% and 85%, respectively, as compared to state of the art.},

Moreover, a novel learning rate design is proposed for the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, which is adaptive to the quality of the gradient estimation. Theoretical analyses are provided on the convergence rate of the proposed AGA solution.

To address this problem, this article presents a collaborative Big.Little branch architecture to enable efficient FL for AIoT applications. Inspired by the architecture of BranchyNet which has multiple prediction branches, our approach deploys deep neural network (DNN) models across both cloud and AIoT devices. Our Big.Little branch model has two branches, where the big branch is deployed on cloud for strengthened prediction accuracy, and the little branches are used to fit for AIoT devices. When AIoT devices cannot make the prediction with high confidence using local little branches, they will resort to the big branch for further inference. To increase both prediction accuracy and early exit rate of Big.Little branch model, we propose a two-stage training and coinference scheme, which considers the local characteristics of AIoT scenarios. Comprehensive experiment results obtained from a real AIoT environment demonstrate the efficiency and effectiveness of our approach in terms of prediction accuracy and average inference time.},

CDFL systems need to ensure fairness, trustworthiness, and high-quality model availability across all the participants in the underlying training networks. This article presents a blockchain-based framework, TrustFed, for CDFL systems to detect the model poisoning attacks, enable fair training settings, and maintain the participating devices' reputation. TrustFed provides fairness by detecting and removing the attackers from the training distributions. It uses blockchain smart contracts to maintain participating devices' reputations to compel the participants in bringing active and honest model contributions. We implemented the TrustFed using a Python-simulated federated learning framework, blockchain smart contracts, and statistical outlier detection techniques. We tested it over the large-scale industrial Internet of things dataset and multiple attack models. We found that TrustFed produces better results regarding multiple aspects compared with the conventional baseline approaches.},

  abstract     = {The use of IoT has become pervasive and IoT devices are common in many domains. Industrial IoT (IIoT) utilises IoT devices and sensors to monitor machines and environments to ensure optimal performance of equipment and processes. Predictive Maintenance (PM) which monitors the health of machines to determine the probable failure of components is one IIoT technique which is receiving attention lately. To achieve effective PM, massive amounts of data are collected, processed and ultimately analysed by Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Traditionally IoT sensors transmit their data readings to the cloud for processing and modelling. Handling and transmitting massive amounts of data between IoT devices and infrastructure has a cost. Edge Computing (EC) in which both sensors and intermediate nodes can process data provides opportunities to reduce data transmission costs and increase processing speed. This article examines IIoT for PM and discusses how and where data can be processed and analysed. Initially, this article presents sampling and data reduction techniques. These techniques allow for a reduction in the amount of data transmitted to the cloud for processing but there are potential accuracy trade-offs when ML algorithms utilise reduced datasets. An alternative approach is to move ML algorithms closer to the data to reduce data transmission. There are three main techniques that utilise the EC paradigm to perform ML and data processing on intermediary nodes. These techniques are categorized according to where data processing occurs: Device and Edge, Edge and Cloud and Device and Cloud (Federated Learning). In addition to exploring traditional approaches, these three state-of-the-art techniques are examined in this article and their benefits and weaknesses are presented. A novel architecture to demonstrate how EC can be utilized both for data reduction and PM in IIoT is also proposed.},

Existing irradiation forecasting methods have achieved excellent performance with a massive amount of data in a centralized way. However, concerns about privacy protection and data security, which may arise in the process of data collection and transmission from distributed points to the centralized server, pose challenges to current forecasting methods. In this article, a novel federated probabilistic forecasting scheme of solar irradiation is proposed based on deep learning, variational Bayesian inference, and federated learning (FL). In this scheme, the training data are stored and computed in local Internet of Things devices, only forecasting models are shared. Two real-world datasets from SolarGIS and National Solar Radiation Database, and one benchmark dataset of Folsom are used to verify the feasibility and performance of the federated-based scheme. Comprehensive case studies are conducted to analyze the performance of the proposed scheme in multihorizon. And the effects of using meteorological features and variational Bayesian inference are evaluated. Compared with other state-of-the-art probabilistic centralized models, when data can be shared, the proposed scheme achieves competitive forecasting performance on the basis of data privacy protection. When data sharing is unavailable, due to the cooperative nature inherent (model-sharing) of FL, the performance advantage of the proposed scheme is more obvious.},

Mobile devices and IoT devices with computing capabilities can join social computing anytime and anywhere. Federated learning allows for the full use of decentralized training devices without the need for raw data, providing convenience in breaking data silos further and delivering more precise services. However, the various attacks illustrate that the current training process of federal learning is still threatened by disclosures at both the data and content levels. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid privacy-preserving method for federal learning to meet the challenges above. First, we employ an advanced function encryption algorithm that not only protects the characteristics of the data uploaded by each client, but also protects the weight of each participant in the weighted summation procedure. By designing local Bayesian differential privacy, the noise mechanism can effectively improve the adaptability of different distributed data sets. In addition, we also use Sparse Differential Gradient to improve the transmission and storage efficiency in federal learning training. Experiments show that when we use the sparse differential gradient to improve the transmission efficiency, the accuracy of the model is only dropped by 3% at most.},

However, in conventional IIoT device failure detection, client devices need to upload raw data to the central server for model training, which might lead to disclosure of sensitive business data. Therefore, in this article, to ensure client data privacy, we propose a blockchain-based federated learning approach for device failure detection in IIoT. First, we present a platform architecture of blockchain-based federated learning systems for failure detection in IIoT, which enables verifiable integrity of client data. In the architecture, each client periodically creates a Merkle tree in which each leaf node represents a client data record, and stores the tree root on a blockchain. Furthermore, to address the data heterogeneity issue in IIoT failure detection, we propose a novel centroid distance weighted federated averaging (CDW_FedAvg) algorithm taking into account the distance between positive class and negative class of each client data set. In addition, to motivate clients to participate in federated learning, a smart contact-based incentive mechanism is designed depending on the size and the centroid distance of client data used in local model training. A prototype of the proposed architecture is implemented with our industry partner, and evaluated in terms of feasibility, accuracy, and performance. The results show that the approach is feasible, and has satisfactory accuracy and performance.},

  abstract     = {Currently, the data collected by the Internet of Healthcare Things, i.e., healthcare oriented Internet of Things (IoT), still rely on cloud-based centralized data aggregation and processing. To reduce the need for transmission of data to the cloud, the edge computing architecture may be adopted to facilitate machine learning at the edge of the network through leveraging on the amassed computation resources of pervasive IoT devices. In this article, federated learning (FL) is proposed to enable privacy-preserving collaborative model training at the edge of the network across distributed IoT users. However, the users in the FL network may have different willingness to participate (WTP), a hidden information unknown to the model owner. Furthermore, the development of healthcare applications typically requires sustainable user participation, e.g., for the continuous collection of data during which a user’s WTP may change over time. As such, we leverage on the dynamic contract design to consider a two-period incentive mechanism that satisfies the intertemporal incentive compatibility (IIC), such that the self-revealing mechanism of the contract holds across both periods. The performance evaluation shows that our contract design satisfies the IIC constraints and derives greater profits than that of the uniform pricing scheme, thus validating its effectiveness in mitigating the adverse impacts of the information asymmetry.},

  abstract     = {The sheer volume of industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) malware is one of the most serious security threats in today's interconnected world, with new types of advanced persistent threats and advanced forms of obfuscations. This article presents a robust federated learning based architecture called Fed-IIoT for detecting Android malware applications in IIoT. Fed-IIoT consists of two parts: first, participant side, where the data are triggered by two dynamic poisoning attacks based on a generative adversarial network (GAN) and federated GAN; and second, server side, which aims to monitor the global model and shape a robust collaboration training model, by avoiding anomaly in aggregation by a GAN network (A3GAN) and adjust two GAN-based countermeasure algorithms. One of the main advantages of Fed-IIoT is that devices can safely participate in the IIoT and efficiently communicate with each other, with no privacy issues. We evaluate our solutions through experiments on various features using three IoT datasets. The results confirm the high accuracy rates of our attack and defense algorithms and show that the A3GAN defensive approach preserves the robustness of data privacy for Android mobile users and is about 8% higher accuracy with existing state-of-the-art solutions.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we aim to make the best joint decision of device selection and computing and spectrum resource allocation for optimizing federated learning (FL) performance in distributed industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) networks. To implement efficient FL over geographically dispersed data, we introduce a three-layer collaborative FL architecture to support deep neural network (DNN) training. Specifically, using the data dispersed in IIoT devices, the industrial gateways locally train the DNN model and the local models can be aggregated by their associated edge servers every FL epoch or by a cloud server every a few FL epochs for obtaining the global model. To optimally select participating devices and allocate computing and spectrum resources for training and transmitting the model parameters, we formulate a stochastic optimization problem with the objective of minimizing FL evaluating loss while satisfying delay and long-term energy consumption requirements. Since the objective function of the FL evaluating loss is implicit and the energy consumption is temporally correlated, it is difficult to solve the problem via traditional optimization methods. Thus, we propose a “Reinforcement on Federated” (RoF) scheme, based on deep multi-agent reinforcement learning, to solve the problem. Specifically, the RoF scheme is executed decentralizedly at edge servers, which can cooperatively make the optimal device selection and resource allocation decisions. Moreover, a device refinement subroutine is embedded into the RoF scheme to accelerate convergence while effectively saving the on-device energy. Simulation results demonstrate that the RoF scheme can facilitate efficient FL and achieve better performance compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

In the IoT system of the future, IoFT, the “cloud” will be substituted by the “crowd” where model training is brought to the edge, allowing IoT devices to collaboratively extract knowledge and build smart analytics/models while keeping their personal data stored locally. This paradigm shift was set into motion by the tremendous increase in computational power on IoT devices and the recent advances in decentralized and privacy-preserving model training, coined as federated learning (FL). This article provides a vision for IoFT and a systematic overview of current efforts towards realizing this vision. Specifically, we first introduce the defining characteristics of IoFT and discuss FL data-driven approaches, opportunities, and challenges that allow decentralized inference within three dimensions: (i) a global model that maximizes utility across all IoT devices, (ii) a personalized model that borrows strengths across all devices yet retains its own model, (iii) a meta-learning model that quickly adapts to new devices or learning tasks. We end by describing the vision and challenges of IoFT in reshaping different industries through the lens of domain experts. Those industries include manufacturing, transportation, energy, healthcare, quality & reliability, business, and computing.},

It is therefore crucial for an IoT network design to identify attackers accurately, quickly and promptly.

Our proposal in this paper is an edge-cloud architecture that fulfills the detection task right at the edge layer, near the source of the attacks for quick response, versatility, as well as reducing the Cloud's workload. We also propose a multi-attack detection mechanism called LocKedge (Low-Complexity Cyberattack Detection in IoT Edge Computing), which has low complexity for deployment at the edge zone while still maintaining high accuracy. LocKedge is implemented in two manners: centralized manner and federated learning manner in order to verify the performance of the architecture from different perspectives. The performance of our proposed mechanism is compared with that of other machine learning and deep learning methods using the most updated BoT-IoT data set. The results show that LocKedge outperforms other algorithms such as NN, CNN, RNN, KNN, SVM, KNN, RF and Decision Tree in terms of accuracy and NN in terms of complexity.},

The selection of clients participating in FL process is currently at complete/quasi randomness. However, the heterogeneity of the client devices within Internet-of-Things environment and their limited communication and computation resources might fail to complete the training task, which may lead to many discarded learning rounds affecting the model accuracy.

Particularly, in each round, the number of clients in FedMCCS is maximized to the utmost, while considering each client resources and its capability to successfully train and send the needed updates. The conducted experiments show that FedMCCS outperforms the other approaches by: 1) reducing the number of communication rounds to reach the intended accuracy; 2) maximizing the number of clients; 3) handling the least number of discarded rounds; and 4) optimizing the network traffic.},

As a complementary, blockchain technology is used in recent literature to make FL secure. However, existing blockchain-based FL (BFL) solutions do not perform well when data in a BFL cluster are sparse. A direct solution is to collect as many devices as possible to establish a large BFL cluster. However, these devices may locate in geographically distant areas and be separated by great distance, which further results in high communication latency. The high latency will lead to BFL’s low system efficiency due to frequent communications in the blockchain consensus. In this article, we propose that the large cluster should be divided into multiple smaller clusters, each in its own geographical area and organized with a BFL. In this context, we propose CFL, a cross-cluster FL system facilitated by the cross-chain technique. CFL connects multiple BFL clusters, where only a few aggregated updates are transmitted over long distances across clusters, thus improving the system efficiency. The design of CFL focuses on a cross-chain consensus protocol, which guarantees the model updates to be exchanged securely across clusters. We carry out extensive experiments to evaluate CFL in comparison with BFL, and show both CFL’s feasibility and efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Industrial Internet of Thing (IIoT) systems are considered attractive ransomware targets because they operate critical services that affect human lives and have substantial operational costs. The major concern is with brownfield IIoT systems since they have legacy edge systems that are not fully prepared to integrate with IoT technologies. Various existing security solutions can detect and mitigate such attacks but are often ineffective due to the heterogeneous and distributed nature of the IIoT systems and their interoperability demands. Consequently, developing new detection solutions is essential. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel targeted ransomware detection model tailored for IIoT edge systems. It uses Asynchronous Peer-to-Peer Federated Learning (AP2PFL) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques as a targeted ransomware detection algorithm. The proposed model consists of two modules: 1) Data Purifying Module (DPM) aims to refine and reconstruct a valuable and robust representation of data based on Contractive Denoising Auto-Encoder (CDAE), and 2) Diagnostic and Decision Module (DDM) is used to identify targeted ransomware and its stages based on Deep Neural Network (DNN) and Batch Normalization (BN). The main strengths of this proposed model include: 1) each edge gateway’s modules work cooperatively with its neighbors in an asynchronous manner and without a third party, 2) it deals with both homogeneous and heterogeneous data, and 3) it is robust against evasion attacks. An exhaustive set of experiments on three datasets prove the high effectiveness of the proposed model in detecting targeted ransomware (known and unknown attacks) in brownfield IIoT and the superiority over the state-of-the-art models.},

  abstract     = {Smartphones, wearables, and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices produce a wealth of data that cannot be accumulated in a centralized repository for learning supervised models due to privacy, bandwidth limitations, and the prohibitive cost of annotations. Federated learning provides a compelling framework for learning models from decentralized data, but conventionally, it assumes the availability of labeled samples, whereas on-device data are generally either unlabeled or cannot be annotated readily through user interaction. To address these issues, we propose a self-supervised approach termed scalogram-signal correspondence learning based on wavelet transform (WT) to learn useful representations from unlabeled sensor inputs as electroencephalography, blood volume pulse, accelerometer, and WiFi channel-state information. Our auxiliary task requires a deep temporal neural network to determine if a given pair of a signal and its complementary view (i.e., a scalogram generated with WT) align with each other, by optimizing a contrastive objective. We extensively assess the quality of learned features with our multiview strategy on diverse public data sets, achieving strong performance in all domains. We demonstrate the effectiveness of representations learned from an unlabeled input collection on downstream tasks with training a linear classifier over pretrained network, usefulness in low-data regime, transfer learning, and cross-validation. Our methodology achieves competitive performance with fully supervised networks and it works significantly better than pretraining with autoencoders in both central and federated contexts. Notably, it improves the generalization in a semisupervised setting as it reduces the volume of labeled data required through leveraging self-supervised learning.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is a promising new technology in the field of IoT intelligence. However, exchanging model-related data in FL may leak the sensitive information of participants. To address this problem, we propose a novel privacy-preserving FL framework based on an innovative chained secure multiparty computing technique, named chain-PPFL. Our scheme mainly leverages two mechanisms: 1) single-masking mechanism that protects information exchanged between participants and 2) chained-communication mechanism that enables masked information to be transferred between participants with a serial chain frame. We conduct extensive simulation-based experiments using two public data sets (MNIST and CIFAR-100) by comparing both training accuracy and leak defence with other state-of-the-art schemes. We set two data sample distributions (IID and NonIID) and three training models (CNN, MLP, and L-BFGS) in our experiments. The experimental results demonstrate that the chain-PPFL scheme can achieve practical privacy preservation (equivalent to differential privacy with ∈ approaching zero) for FL with some cost of communication and without impairing the accuracy and convergence speed of the training model.},

Based on the incentive of FL model training, each individual device makes offloading decisions for their tactical tasks in resource-constrained network environments. According to the ideas of two different bargaining solutions -weighted average solution and constant elasticity substitution solution - edge server and IoT devices work together in a coordinated manner to approximate a well-balanced system performance. Therefore, we can reach an agreement while exploring the mutual benefits to leverage a reciprocal consensus between different viewpoints. The main novelty of our approach is to investigate the dual-interactive bargaining process based on the interdependent relationship between IoT devices and the tactical edge server. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that jointly considers different bargaining solutions to handle tactical edge-assisted task offloading services. Based on the numerical simulation, it is demonstrated that the proposed approach can increase the system throughput, device payoff and device fairness up to 10%, 15% and 20%, respectively, in comparison with existing protocols.},

Complicated interference caused by mixed signals on industrial equipments may significantly degrade the classification rate of signals, which may result in a long training time in order to extract features. In addition, with limited channel resources, it is difficult to make the global optimal decision in industrial distributed wireless sensor networks. To address this problem, a signal classification method using feature fusion is proposed for industrial Internet of Things in this article. In the proposed method, the received signals of nodes are processed by frequency reduction and sampling pretreatment, based on which intelligent representations of signals are obtained. Using federated learning, the data samples are trained with the feature fusion network. Moreover, the trained deep learning network is used on each sensor node to classify signals, the results of which will be transmitted to aggregation center. In the aggregation center, the improved evidence theory method is used to aggregate the recognition results of each sensor node to achieve the final classification. Simulation shows that the proposed method has excellent classification performances. Notably, it is not required for the proposed method to transmit signals from nodes to the aggregation center, which could effectively protect the privacy of industrial information.},

  abstract     = {The simultaneous development of deep learning techniques and Internet of Things (IoT)/Cyber-physical Systems (CPS) technologies has afforded untold possibilities for improving distributed computing, sensing, and data analysis. Among these technologies, federated learning has received increased attention as a privacy-preserving collaborative learning paradigm, and has shown significant potential in IoT/CPS-driven large-scale smart-world systems. At the same time, the vulnerabilities of deep neural networks, especially to adversarial attacks, cannot be overstated and should not be minimized. Moreover, the distributed nature of federated learning makes defense against such adversarial attacks a more challenging problem due to the unavailability of local data and resource heterogeneity. To tackle these challenges, in this paper, we propose ZeKoC, a Zero Knowledge Clustering approach to mitigating adversarial attacks. Particularly, we first formulate the problem of resource-constrained adversarial mitigation. Specifically, noting that a global server has no access to training samples, we reformulate the unsupervised weight clustering problem. Our proposed ZeKoC approach allows the server to automatically split and merge weight clusters for weight selection and aggregation. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that convergence is guaranteed. Further, our experimental results illustrate that, in a non-i.i.d. (i.e., independent and identically distributed) data setting, the proposed ZeKoC approach successfully mitigates general attacks while outperforming state-of-art schemes.},

In this article, we model these unreliable behaviors of clients and propose a defensive mechanism to mitigate such a security risk. Specifically, we first investigate the impact on the models caused by unreliable clients by deriving a convergence upper bound on the loss function based on the gradient descent updates. Our bounds reveal that with a fixed amount of total computational resources, there exists an optimal number of local training iterations in terms of convergence performance. We further design a novel defensive mechanism, named deep neural network-based secure aggregation (DeepSA). Our experimental results validate our theoretical analysis. In addition, the effectiveness of DeepSA is verified by comparing with other state-of-the-art defensive mechanisms.},

According to the different requirement of end users, these data usually have high heterogeneity and privacy, while most of users are reluctant to expose them to the public view. How to manage these time series data in an efficient and safe way in the field of IIoT is still an open issue, such that it has attracted extensive attention from academia and industry. As a new machine learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) has great advantages in training heterogeneous and private data. This article studies the FL technology applications to manage IIoT equipment data in wireless network environments. In order to increase the model aggregation rate and reduce communication costs, we apply deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to IIoT equipment selection process, specifically to select those IIoT equipment nodes with accurate models. Therefore, we propose a FL algorithm assisted by DRL, which can take into account the privacy and efficiency of data training of IIoT equipment. By analyzing the data characteristics of IIoT equipments, we use MNIST, fashion MNIST, and CIFAR-10 datasets to represent the data generated by IIoT. During the experiment, we employ the deep neural network model to train the data, and experimental results show that the accuracy can reach more than 97%, which corroborates the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Furthermore, a rapid upsurge in the number of IoT devices is expected in the foreseeable future. Although FL enables privacy-preserving, on-device machine learning, it still exhibits a privacy leakage issue. A malicious aggregation server can infer the sensitive information of other end-devices using their local learning model updates. Furthermore, centralized FL aggregation server might stop working due to security attack or a physical damage. To address the aforementioned issues, we propose a novel concept of socially-aware-clustering-enabled dispersed FL. First, we present a novel framework for socially-aware-clustering-enabled dispersed FL. Second, we formulate a problem for minimizing the loss function of the proposed FL scheme. Third, we decompose the formulated problem into three sub-problems, such as local devices relative accuracy minimization (i.e., end-devices local accuracy maximization) sub-problem, clustering sub-problem, and resource allocation sub-problem, due to the NP-hard nature of the formulated problem. The clustering and resource allocation sub-problems are solved using low complexity schemes based on a matching theory. The end devices' relative accuracy minimization problem is solved by using a convex optimizer. Finally, numerical results are provided for validation of the proposed FL scheme. Furthermore, we show the convergence of the proposed FL scheme for image classification tasks using the MNIST dataset.},

The image data sharing procedure toward central cloud servers in order to perform real-time classifications has leaked client personalization and heavily burdened the communication networks. Thus, the deployment of IoT image sensors in privacy-constrained sectors requires an optimized federated learning (FL) scheme to efficiently consider both aspects of securing data privacy and maximizing the model accuracy with sufficient communication and computation resources. In this article, an adaptive model communication scheme with virtual resource optimization for edge FL is proposed by converging a deep q-learning algorithm to enforce a self-learning agent interacting with network functions virtualization orchestrator and software-defined networking based architecture. The agent targets to optimize the resource control policy of virtual multi-access edge computing entities in virtualized infrastructure manager. The proposed scheme trains the learning model and weighs the optimal actions for particular network states by using an epsilon-greedy strategy. In the exploitation phase, the scheme considers multiple spatial-resolution sensing conditions and allocates computation offloading resources for global multiconvolutional neural networks model aggregation based on the congestion states. In the simulation results, the quality of service and global collaborative model performance metrics were evaluated in terms of delay, packet drop ratios, packet delivery ratios, loss values, and overall accuracy.},

This distributed approach is promising in the mobile systems where have a large corpus of decentralized data and require high privacy. However, unlike the common datasets, the data distribution of the mobile systems is imbalanced which will increase the bias of model. In this article, we demonstrate that the imbalanced distributed training data will cause an accuracy degradation of FL applications. To counter this problem, we build a self-balancing FL framework named Astraea, which alleviates the imbalances by 1) Z-score-based data augmentation, and 2) Mediator-based multi-client rescheduling. The proposed framework relieves global imbalance by adaptive data augmentation and downsampling, and for averaging the local imbalance, it creates the mediator to reschedule the training of clients based on Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) of their data distribution. Compared with FedAvg, the vanilla FL algorithm, Astraea shows +4.39 and +6.51 percent improvement of top-1 accuracy on the imbalanced EMNIST and imbalanced CINIC-10 datasets, respectively. Meanwhile, the communication traffic of Astraea is reduced by 75 percent compared to FedAvg.},

Specifically, the data owners (e.g., IoT device consumers) keep their raw data and only share their local computation results to train the global model of the model owner (e.g., an IoT service provider). When executing the federated learning task, the data owners contribute their computation and communication resources. In this situation, the data owners have to face privacy issues where attackers may infer data property or recover the raw data based on the shared information. Considering these disadvantages, the data owners will be reluctant to use their data to participate in federated learning without a well-designed incentive mechanism. In this article, we deliberately design an incentive mechanism jointly considering the task expenditure and privacy issue of federated learning. Based on a differentially private federated learning (DPFL) framework that can prevent the privacy leakage of the data owners, we model the contribution as well as the computation, communication, and privacy costs of each data owner. The three types of costs are data owners' private information unknown to the model owner, which thus forms an information asymmetry. To maximize the utility of the model owner under such information asymmetry, we leverage a 3-D contract approach to design the incentive mechanism. The simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed incentive mechanism with the DPFL framework compared to other baseline mechanisms.},

Network slicing is recognized as a flagship technology that enables IIoT networks with multiservices and resource requirements by allowing the network-as-infrastructure transition to the network-as-service. Motivated by the increasing IIoT computational capacity, and taking into consideration the QoS satisfaction and private data sharing challenges, federated reinforcement learning (RL) has become a promising approach that distributes data acquisition and computation tasks over distributed network agents, exploiting local computation capacities and agent's self-learning experiences. This article proposes a novel deep RL scheme to provide a federated and dynamic network management and resource allocation for differentiated QoS services in future IIoT networks. This involves IIoT slices resource allocation in terms of transmission power (TP) and spreading factor (SF) according to the slices QoS requirements. Toward this goal, the proposed deep federated Q-learning (DFQL) is reached into two main steps. First, we propose a multiagent deep Q-learning-based dynamic slices TP and SF adjustment process that aims at maximizing self-QoS requirements in term of throughput and delay. Second, the deep federated learning is proposed to learn multiagent self-model and enable them to find an optimal action decision on the TP and the SF that satisfy IIoT virtual network slice QoS reward, exploiting the shared experiences between agents. Simulation results show that the proposed DFQL framework achieves efficient performance compared to the traditional approaches.},

In this article, we give a comprehensive exploration of the poisoning attack mechanisms in the context of federated learning. We first present a poison data generation method, named Data_Gen, based on the generative adversarial networks (GANs). This method mainly relies upon the iteratively updated global model parameters to regenerate samples of interested victims. Second, we further propose a novel generative poisoning attack model, named PoisonGAN, against the federated learning framework. This model utilizes the designed Data_Gen method to efficiently reduce the attack assumptions and make attacks feasible in practice. We finally evaluate our data generation and attack models by implementing two types of typical poisoning attack strategies, label flipping and backdoor, on a federated learning prototype. The experimental results demonstrate that these two attack models are effective in federated learning.},

  abstract     = {Deep convoloutional networks have been widely deployed in modern cyber-physical systems performing different visual classification tasks. As the fog and edge devices have different computing capacity and perform different subtasks, models trained for one device may not be deployable on another. Knowledge distillation technique can effectively compress well trained convolutional neural networks into light-weight models suitable to different devices. However, due to privacy issue and transmission cost, manually annotated data for training the deep learning models are usually gradually collected and archived in different sites. Simply training a model on powerful cloud servers and compressing them for particular edge devices failed to use the distributed data stored at different sites. This offline training approach is also inefficient to deal with new data collected from the edge devices. To overcome these obstacles, in this article, we propose the heterogeneous brain storming (HBS) method for object recognition tasks in real-world Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios. Our method enables flexible bidirectional federated learning of heterogeneous models trained on distributed datasets with a new “brain storming” mechanism and optimizable temperature parameters. In our comparison experiments, this HBS method outperformed multiple state-of-the-art single-model compression methods, as well as the newest multinetwork knowledge distillation methods with both homogeneous and heterogeneous classifiers. The ablation experiment results proved that the trainable temperature parameter into the conventional knowledge distillation loss can effectively ease the learning process of student networks in different methods. To the best of authors' knowledge, this is the first IoT-oriented method that allows asynchronous bidirectional heterogeneous knowledge distillation in deep networks.},

  abstract     = {Smart grid applications, such as predicting energy consumption, grid user behavior analysis and predicting energy theft, etc., are data-driven applications that require machine learning with a wealth of data generated from Internet of Things (IoT) based metering devices. However, traditional methods of uploading this huge data to the remote cloud for data analytics may be low efficient due to the non-negligible network transmission delay. By deploying a number of computing-enabled devices at the network edge, edge computing supports the implementation of machine learning close to the power grid environment. Considering the limited computing resources of edge devices and non-independent and identical (non-IID) data source, federated learning is a feasible edge computing based machine learning model. In federated learning, distributed mobile clients and a federated server collaborate to perform machine learning. Generally, the more clients to join the federated learning, the faster to obtain learning convergence and the higher resource utility. However, the communications between clients and the server in training rounds of federated learning may fail due to time-varying link reliability properties in a wireless network of smart grid, which not only slows down the model convergence rate but also wastes resources, such as energy consumption for invalid local training. This paper studies a dynamic federated learning problem in a power grid mobile edge computing (GMEC) environment, considering the high dynamic of link reliability. We design a delay deadline constrained federated learning framework to avoid extremely long training delay, and then formulate a dynamic client selection problem for computing utility maximization in such learning framework. Two online client selection algorithms, including cli-max greedy and uti-positive guarantee, are proposed to address the problem. The theoretical analysis and simulation results are conducted to illustrate the efficiency of the proposal.},

  abstract     = {Due to air quality significantly affects human health, it is becoming increasingly important to accurately and timely predict the air quality index (AQI). To this end, this article proposes a new federated learning (FL)-based aerial-ground air quality sensing framework for fine-grained 3-D air quality monitoring and forecasting. Specifically, in the air, this framework leverages a lightweight Dense-MobileNet model to achieve energy-efficient end-to-end learning from haze features of haze images taken by unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for predicting AQI scale distribution. Furthermore, the FL framework not only allows various organizations or institutions to collaboratively learn a well-trained global model to monitor AQI without compromising privacy but also expands the scope of UAV swarms monitoring. For ground sensing systems, we propose a graph convolutional neural network-based long short-term memory (GC-LSTM) model to achieve accurate, real time, and future AQI inference. The GC-LSTM model utilizes the topological structure of the ground monitoring station to capture the spatiotemporal correlation of historical observation data, which helps the aerial-ground sensing system to achieve accurate AQI inference. Through extensive case studies on a real-world data set, numerical results show that the proposed framework can achieve accurate and energy-efficient AQI sensing without compromising the privacy of raw data.},

In the considered network, high-altitude balloons (HABs), acting as flying wireless base stations, can use their powerful computational capabilities to process the computational tasks offloaded from their associated users. Since the data size of each user’s computational task varies over time, the HABs must dynamically adjust their resource allocation schemes to meet the users’ needs. This problem is posed as an optimization problem, whose goal is to minimize the energy and time consumption for task computation and transmission by adjusting the user association, service sequence, and task allocation schemes. To solve this problem, a support vector machine (SVM)-based federated learning (FL) algorithm is proposed to determine the user association proactively. The proposed SVM-based FL method enables HABs to cooperatively build an SVM model that can determine all user associations without any transmissions of either user historical associations or computational tasks to other HABs. Given the predictions of the optimal user association, the service sequence and task allocation of each user can be optimized so as to minimize the weighted sum of the energy and time consumption. Simulations with real-city cellular traffic data show that the proposed algorithm can reduce the weighted sum of the energy and time consumption of all users by up to 15.4% compared to a conventional centralized method.},

We, as humans, just need to find a way to make the best use of the current technological advances. The pandemic has managed to exploit our deepest vulnerabilities and insecurities. We need to cope with a lot of things, just to be comfortable in the new normal. Hence, we can rely on technology, the greatest asset developed by humans. In this article, we discuss how we can enhance the work environment in offices post-pandemic. We combine federated learning with emotion analysis to create a state-of-the-art, simple, secure, and efficient emotion monitoring system. We combine facial expression and speech signals to find out macroexpressions and create an emotion index that is monitored to find the mental health of the user. Federated learning enables users to locally train the model without compromising his/her privacy. In place of sending data to the centralized server, the proposed scheme sends only model weights that are combined at the server to make a better global model, which is further pushed back to the users. This model is then trained interorganizational as it does not violate the privacy or data sharing to achieve optimal results. The data collected from users are monitored to analyze the mental health and presented with counseling solutions during low times. Technology is a panacea that has enabled us to survive in this pandemic, and by using our solution to improve work culture and the environment in post-pandemic times.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, Federated Learning has widely been adopted for data security in the Industrial IoTs. With Federated Learning, local Industrial IoTs devices download the current machine learning model and update it on their own local Industrial IoTs devices. Then, local Industrial IoTs devices transmit these locally trained models back to the Industrial Server. The Industrial Server aggregates all the locally trained models into a single consolidated and enhanced global model. On one side, Federated Learning secures the data; on the other side, Federated Learning itself is vulnerable to one subtle yet severe attack: the model poisoning attack. Model poisoning attack is difficult to detect, especially in Industrial IoTs applications, for two reasons: 1) neither the Industrial Server nor the local Industrial IoTs devices in Federated Learning is capable of identifying poisoned local models; 2) every iteration of Federated Learning consists of many Industrial IoTs devices, and therefore, verification of every single device is computationally expensive. Thus, this study proposes an effective and efficient framework for deTectIon of Model Poisoning Attacks usiNg AccuracY (TIMPANY). TIMPANY is the first detection framework for the model poisoning attack that utilizes accuracy as a detection measure. We performed theoretical analysis of TIMPANY with other detection solutions (for model poisoning attack) concerning communication and computational efficiency, security, and detection accuracy. Our thorough theoretical comparative analysis showed that TIMPANY efficiently addresses these open research challenges that previous studies failed to address. In our thorough experimental analysis, error analysis from the first iteration shows that TIMPANY results in 0% error, leading to a True Positive Rate and accuracy of 100% with 0% False Positive Rate. Thus, TIMPANY outperformed some of the existing detection solutions for model poisoning attacks against Federated Learning. We conclude that TIMPANY is effective and efficient against model poisoning attacks in Federated Learning, even for resource-constrained Industrial IoTs devices widely used in various industrial applications.},

Rich vehicle-related data collection allows to apply artificial intelligence (AI) such as machine learning and deep learning (DL) to develop advanced services in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS). However, AI/DL-based ITS applications require intensive computation, both for model training and deployment. The exploitation of the huge computational power obtained through aggregation of resources present in individual vehicles and ITS infrastructure brings an efficient solution. In this work, oneVFC, a tangible vehicular fog computing (VFC) platform based on oneM2M is proposed. It benefits from the oneM2M standard to facilitate interoperability as well as hierarchical resource organization. oneVFC manages the distributed resources, orchestrates information flows and computing tasks on vehicle fog nodes and feeds back results to the application users. On a lab scale model consisting of Raspberry Pi modules and laptops, we demonstrate how oneVFC manages the AI-driven applications running on various machines and how it succeeds in significantly reducing application processing time, especially in cases with high workload or with requests arriving at high pace. We also show how oneVFC facilitates the deployment of AI model training in Federated Learning (FL), an advanced privacy preserving and communication saving training approach. Our experiments deployed in an outdoor environment with mobile fog nodes participating in the computation jobs confirm the feasibility of oneVFC for IoV environments whenever the communication links among fog nodes are guaranteed by V2X technology.},

The incorporation of over-the-air aggregation for signal transmission naturally harnesses the channel perturbations and interference for lower communication complexity and preserved privacy. Despite the influence of transmission noise and channel distortion, convergence analysis is provided for general objective functions, which illustrates the robust training performance of the proposed algorithm with a theoretical guarantee.},

To improve the communication efficiency of FL implementations in wireless systems, recent works have proposed compression and dimension reduction mechanisms, along with digital and analog transmission schemes that account for channel noise, fading, and interference. The prior art has mainly focused on star topologies consisting of distributed clients and a central server. In contrast, this paper studies FL over wireless device-to-device (D2D) networks by providing theoretical insights into the performance of digital and analog implementations of decentralized stochastic gradient descent (DSGD). First, we introduce generic digital and analog wireless implementations of communication-efficient DSGD algorithms, leveraging random linear coding (RLC) for compression and over-the-air computation (AirComp) for simultaneous analog transmissions. Next, under the assumptions of convexity and connectivity, we provide convergence bounds for both implementations. The results demonstrate the dependence of the optimality gap on the connectivity and on the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels in the network. The analysis is corroborated by experiments on an image-classification task.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, there is an ever-increasing interests in federated learning, which allows end devices to collaboratively train a global machine learning model in a decentralized paradigm without sharing individual data. Despite the advantages of low communication cost and preserving data privacy, federated learning is also facing with new challenges to address. Practically, end devices will consider the resources cost and willingness caused by machine learning model training when they are invited to participate a federated learning task. So, how to assign the preferable tasks to the devices with high willingness has to be considered. Besides, the end devices have the property of high mobility, which means the time of devices localizing within the network is limited. Therefore, to reduce the task execution time is necessary. To address these problems, we first analyze and formulate the latency minimization problem for multitask federated learning in a multiaccess edge computing (MEC) network scenario. Then, we model the corresponding problem as a matching game to find the optimal task assignment solutions. Moreover, considering the large-scale Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenario, it is almost impossible for two sides to know the details of every individual of the other side so that the complete preference list (CPL) cannot be built in reality. Therefore, we propose an algorithm for large-scale matching with the incomplete preference list to address the problem. Finally, we conduct the numerical simulation in various cases to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The results show that our approach can achieve similar performance with the CPL case.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as an important and promising learning scheme in IoT, enabling devices to jointly learn a model without sharing their raw data sets. As FL does not collect and store the data centrally, it requires frequent model exchange through the wireless network. However, since the aggregation in FL can be partially participated with synchronized frequency, its communication pattern is different from the conventional network. Therein, limited bandwidth and package loss restrict interactions in training. Thus, the network scheduling could largely affect the FL convergence. To figure out the specific effects, we analyze the convergence rate of FL regarding the joint impact of communication and training. Combining it with the network model, we formulate the optimal scheduling problem for FL implementation. The theoretical results could guide the hyper-parameter design in the network and explain the principle of how the wireless communication could influence the FL training process.},

Multiaccess edge computing (MEC) can enhance the ability of emerging resource-intensive IoT applications and has attracted much attention. However, due to the time-varying network environments, as well as the heterogeneous resources of network devices, it is hard to achieve stable, reliable, and real-time interactions between edge devices and their serving edge servers, especially in the 5G ultradense network (UDN) scenarios. Ultradense edge computing (UDEC) has the potential to fill this gap, especially in the 5G era, but it still faces challenges in its current solutions, such as the lack of: 1) efficient utilization of multiple 5G resources (e.g., computation, communication, storage, and service resources); 2) low overhead offloading decision making and resource allocation strategies; and 3) privacy and security protection schemes. Thus, we first propose an intelligent UDEC (I-UDEC) framework, which integrates blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) into 5G UDEC networks. Then, in order to achieve real-time and low overhead computation offloading decisions and resource allocation strategies, we design a novel two-timescale deep reinforcement learning (2Ts-DRL) approach, consisting of a fast-timescale and a slow-timescale learning process, respectively. The primary objective is to minimize the total offloading delay and network resource usage by jointly optimizing computation offloading, resource allocation, and service caching placement. We also leverage federated learning (FL) to train the 2Ts-DRL model in a distributed manner, aiming to protect the edge devices' data privacy. Simulation results corroborate the effectiveness of both the 2Ts-DRL and FL in the I-UDEC framework and prove that our proposed algorithm can reduce task execution time up to 31.87%.},

  abstract     = {The advancements of AI and the exponential growth of sensory data are unlocking a wave of intelligent sensing applications. To overcome the shortcoming of centralized learning and local training, Google proposes federated learning that allows users to collectively reap the benefits of shared models trained from decentralized data. However, directly applying federated learning to intelligent sensing applications faces two deficiencies: 1) omitting personalities of local models and 2) high latency. Aiming at these limitations, in this article, we propose a new framework, Federated Sensing, to enable edge-cloud elastic collaborative learning from decentralized sensory data. We design an elastic local update algorithm that can train the personalized models by setting specific updating weights for each node based on the difference between the global and local model. Our algorithm takes both the global consistency and the personalities of the local models. We further propose an  $n$ -softsync model aggregation method that significantly reduces training time by combining the synchronous and asynchronous aggregations. Extensive experiments are conducted on two real-world data sets of air quality from Beijing and Los Angeles. Compared with existing federated learning techniques, our framework improves the model performance at least by 2.61% and 18.8% in two data sets, respectively. Besides, it reduces the cloud idle time to 25.5% of the total time, which verifies the advantages of our method in terms of both model performance and training overhead.},

  abstract     = {Medical diagnostic image analysis (e.g., CT scan or X-Ray) using machine learning is an efficient and accurate way to detect COVID-19 infections. However, the sharing of diagnostic images across medical institutions is usually prohibited due to patients’ privacy concerns. This causes the issue of insufficient data sets for training the image classification model. Federated learning is an emerging privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm that produces an unbiased global model based on the received local model updates trained by clients without exchanging clients’ local data. Nevertheless, the default setting of federated learning introduces a huge communication cost of transferring model updates and can hardly ensure model performance when severe data heterogeneity of clients exists. To improve communication efficiency and model performance, in this article, we propose a novel dynamic fusion-based federated learning approach for medical diagnostic image analysis to detect COVID-19 infections. First, we design an architecture for dynamic fusion-based federated learning systems to analyze medical diagnostic images. Furthermore, we present a dynamic fusion method to dynamically decide the participating clients according to their local model performance and schedule the model fusion based on participating clients’ training time. In addition, we summarize a category of medical diagnostic image data sets for COVID-19 detection, which can be used by the machine learning community for image analysis. The evaluation results show that the proposed approach is feasible and performs better than the default setting of federated learning in terms of model performance, communication efficiency, and fault tolerance.},

Specifically, the data-driven navigation framework combines the position estimation offered by the high-sampling inertial measurement units and the position calibration provided by the low-sampling GPS signals. Despite its promise, the privacy preservation and flexibility of the participating users in the federated learning process are still problematic. To address these challenges, in this article, we propose an efficient, flexible, and privacy-preserving model aggregation scheme under a federated learning-based navigation framework named FedLoc. Specifically, our proposed scheme efficiently protects the locally trained model updates, flexibly supports the fluctuation of participants, and is robust against unregistered malicious users by exploiting a homomorphic threshold cryptosystem, together with the bounded Laplace mechanism and the skip list. We perform a detailed security analysis to demonstrate the security properties in terms of privacy preservation and dishonest user detection. In addition, we evaluate and compare the computational efficiency with two traditional schemes, and the simulation results show that our scheme greatly improves the computational efficiency during participant fluctuation. To validate the effectiveness of our scheme, we also show that only part of the model update is excluded from aggregation in the case of a dishonest user.},

This leads to high communication cost, long response time, and privacy concerns. Recently Edge-empowered AI, namely, Edge AI, has been proposed to support AI model learning and deployment at the network edge closer to the data sources. Existing research, including federated learning adopts a centralized architecture for model learning, where a central server aggregates the model updates from the clients/workers. The centralized architecture has drawbacks, such as performance bottleneck, poor scalability, and single point of failure. In this article, we propose a novel decentralized model learning approach, namely, E-Tree, which makes use of a well-designed tree structure imposed on the edge devices. The tree structure and the locations and orders of the aggregation on the tree are optimally designed to improve the training convergency and model accuracy. In particular, we design an efficient device clustering algorithm, named by K-Means and average accuracy, for E-Tree by taking into account the data distribution on the devices as well as the network distance. Evaluation results show that E-Tree significantly outperforms the benchmark approaches, such as federated learning and gossip learning under nonindependently and identically distributed (Non-i.i.d.) data in terms of model accuracy and convergency.},

In this article, we propose VeTorch, a smartphone inertial odometry that devises an inertial sequence learning framework to track vehicles in real time when GPS signal is not available. Specifically, we transform the inertial dynamics from the phone to the vehicle regardless of the arbitrary phone's placement in the car and explore a temporal convolutional network to learn the vehicle's moving dependencies directly from the inertial data. To tackle the heterogeneous smartphone properties and driving habits, we propose a federated learning-based active model training mechanism to produce customized models for individual smartphones, without incurring user privacy issues. We implement a highly efficient prototype and conduct extensive experiments on two large-scale real-world traffic data sets collected by a modern ride-hailing platform. Our results outperform the state-of-the-art vehicular inertial dead-reckoning solutions on both accuracy and efficiency.},

In such a dynamic setting, there is always a likelihood that miners may be compromised or fail to propagate information in time because of some intrinsic factors such as channel impairments, satellite handovers and attacks. Such transmission failures often lead to undesirable forking events in the Blockchain. Consequently, maintaining a low energy consumption and smallish delay in such an erratic network is highly nontrivial and challenging. To quantify the impacts of the forking and minimize the occurrence of such unwanted events and their adverse effects, we develop a procedure to estimate the expected energy consumption for a given set of miners, block transmissions, and LEOs’ or UAVs’ mobility. Besides, we shed light on deep learning-based resource allocation for mobile mining and demonstrate the synergic gain of FL with Blockchain.},

Compared with centralized learning, FL has obvious privacy advantages because it can protect the clients’ raw data from direct access by adversaries. Furthermore, to prevent the adversaries from inferring private information from the transmitted parameters, several FL algorithms based on differential privacy (DP) have been proposed, where the clients add artificial noise to their local parameters for privacy protection. Nevertheless, the added noise would disrupt the learning process and degrade the performance of the trained model. Considering this, in this article, we develop a performance-enhanced DP-based FL (PEDPFL) algorithm, where a classifier-perturbation regularization method is proposed to improve the robustness of the trained model against DP-injected noise. We derive the theoretical privacy and convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm, and also demonstrate the influence of some hyperparameters on the convergence performance. Simulation results on real-world data sets show that the proposed algorithm has better classification performance than the existing DP-based FL algorithms at the same level of privacy protection, and thus, it is more applicable to IoT applications.},

Federated learning (FL) is a promising distributed ML algorithm where the models are trained at the edge devices over the local data sets, and only the model parameters are shared with the cloud server (CS) to generate global model parameters. Nevertheless, due to the limited battery life of the edge devices, improving the energy-efficiency is a prime concern for FL. In this work, we investigate a resource allocation scheme to reduce the overall energy consumption of FL in the relay-assisted IoT networks. We aim at minimizing the overall energy consumption of IoT devices subject to the FL time constraint. FL time consists of model training computation time and wireless transmission latency. Toward this goal, a joint optimization problem, considering scheduling the IoT devices with the relays, transmit power allocation, and computation frequency allocation, is formulated. Due to the NP-hardness of the joint optimization problem, a global optimal solution is intractable. Therefore, leveraging graph theory, joint near-optimal, and low-complexity suboptimal solutions are proposed. Efficiency of our proposed solutions over several benchmark schemes is verified via extensive simulations. Simulation results show that the proposed near-optimal scheme achieves 6, 4, and 2 times lower energy consumption, respectively, compared to the considered fixed, computation adaptation, and power adaptation schemes. Such an appealing energy efficiency comes at the cost of slightly increased FL time compared to the fixed and computation only adaptation schemes.},

CPS is characterized by communication, computing, and control engineering based on a large volume of data originating from various devices, plants, sensors, etc. Wireless technologies have enabled the ease of networking and communications for both CPS and IoT, by providing massive and critical connectivity and control mechanisms. However, they are prone to challenges, such as low latency, throughput, and scheduling. Recent research trends focus on how to intelligently use data from CPS units to enhance wireless connectivity in CPS. AI tools, particularly AI systems and machine learning (ML) algorithms, have been widely applied in the literature to develop efficient schemes for wireless CPS/IoT. This article presents a review on the role of AI in wireless networking for CPS and IoT. In particular, we focus on ML paradigms, such as transfer learning (TL), distributed learning, and federated learning, that have evolved as building blocks for the utilization of large data for learning, adaptation, and predictions in CPS and IoT systems that leverage wireless networking. Furthermore, we also highlight challenges faced by current and future wireless networks pertaining to CPS/IoT, which are yet to be addressed.},

  abstract     = {To leverage massive distributed data and computation resources, machine learning in the network edge is considered to be a promising technique, especially for large-scale model training. Federated learning (FL), as a paradigm of collaborative learning techniques, has obtained increasing research attention with the benefits of communication efficiency and improved data privacy. Due to the lossy communication channels and limited communication resources (e.g., bandwidth and power), it is of interest to investigate fast responding and accurate FL schemes over wireless systems. Hence, we investigate the problem of jointly optimized communication efficiency and resources for FL over wireless Internet of Things (IoT) networks. To reduce complexity, we divide the overall optimization problem into two subproblems, i.e., the client scheduling problem and the resource allocation problem. To reduce the communication costs for FL in wireless IoT networks, a new client scheduling policy is proposed by reusing stale local model parameters. To maximize successful information exchange over networks, a Lagrange multiplier method is first leveraged by decoupling variables, including power variables, bandwidth variables, and transmission indicators. Then, a linear-search-based power and bandwidth allocation method is developed. Given appropriate hyperparameters, we show that the proposed communication-efficient FL (CEFL) framework converges at a strong linear rate. Through extensive experiments, it is revealed that the proposed CEFL framework substantially boosts both the communication efficiency and learning performance of both training loss and test accuracy for FL over wireless IoT networks compared to a basic FL approach with uniform resource allocation.},

  abstract     = {In order to make full use of the network data and guarantee user privacy simultaneously, federated learning (FL) is proposed to enable distributed intelligence for local nodes without sharing data with each other. However, in practice, due to resource limitations, traditional FL suffers from node scheduling and parameter transmission failure, which not only affects the final performance but also further reduces the fairness of the participating nodes. This article addresses the challenge and proposes an FL method to enhance the performance of FL on the basis of guaranteeing the fairness of the local nodes in a resource-constrained Internet of Things (IoT) network. Specifically, an analytical model is first constructed to characterize the performance of FL with joint considerations of node fairness, unreliable parameter transmissions as well as resource limitations. Thereafter, a statistically reweighted aggregation (SRA) scheme is proposed for parameter aggregation and the corresponding model is proved to be unbiased to that based on ideal parameter transmissions. With the knowledge of time dependency of the global model, we further extend SRA and propose a reliable SRA (RSRA) scheme. Additionally, we prove RSRA is able to achieve higher stability performance than SRA in model training. Furthermore, the convergence bound of the proposed RSRA is derived analytically, based on which an adaptive local training scheme is proposed under a given resource budget. Finally, extensive experiments are carried out with a public data set to validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme with comparisons of other baseline schemes.},

Federated learning (FL), as a promising distributed ML paradigm, has been employed recently to improve detection performance due to its advantages of privacy-preserving and lower latency. However, existing FL-based methods still suffer from efficiency, robustness, and security challenges. To address these problems, in this article, we initially introduce a blockchain-empowered decentralized and asynchronous FL framework for anomaly detection in IoT systems, which ensures data integrity and prevents single-point failure while improving the efficiency. Further, we design an improved differentially private FL based on generative adversarial nets, aiming to optimize data utility throughout the training process. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first system to employ a decentralized FL approach with privacy-preserving for IoT anomaly detection. Simulation results on the real-world dataset demonstrate the superior performance from aspects of robustness, accuracy, and fast convergence while maintaining high level of privacy and security protection.},

Specifically, in a multiaccess edge computing setup with a host of IoT devices, FL is most suitable since it leverages distributed client data to train high-performance deep learning (DL) models while keeping the data private. However, the underlying deep neural networks (DNNs) are huge, preventing its direct deployment onto resource-constrained computing and memory-limited IoT devices. Besides, frequent exchange of model updates between the central server and clients in FL could result in a communication bottleneck. To address these challenges, in this article, we introduce GWEP, a model compression-based FL method. It utilizes joint quantization and model pruning to reap the benefits of DNNs while meeting the capabilities of resource-constrained devices. Consequently, by reducing the computational, memory, and network footprint of FL, the low-end IoT devices may be able to participate in the FL process. In addition, we provide theoretical guarantees of FL convergence. Through empirical evaluations, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms the baseline algorithms by being up to 10.23 times faster with 11 times lesser communication rounds, while achieving high-model compression, energy efficiency, and learning performance.},

Then, we devise an encrypted model training scheme (EMT) based on a simple but countervailable differential privacy methodology to prevent attacks from malicious devices. In addition, we also propose a contribution-driven delegated proof of stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism to guarantee the fairness of reward distribution in the block generation process.

The ultimate goal is to extract insights from this data and develop solutions that improve quality of life and generate new revenue.

However, most existing FL methods fail to deal with IoT applications that contain a variety of IoT devices equipped with different types of neural network (NN) models. This is because traditional FL methods assume that local models on devices should have the same architecture as the global model on cloud. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework named PervasiveFL that enables efficient and effective FL among heterogeneous IoT devices. Without modifying original local models, PervasiveFL installs one lightweight NN model named modellet on each device. By using the deep mutual learning (DML) and our entropy-based decision gating (EDG) method, modellets and local models can selectively learn from each other through soft labels using locally captured data. Meanwhile, since modellets are of the same architecture, the learned knowledge by modellets can be shared among devices in a traditional FL manner. In this way, PervasiveFL can be pervasively applied to any heterogeneous IoT system. Comprehensive experimental results on four well-known datasets show that PervasiveFL can not only pervasively enable FL among heterogeneous devices within a large-scale IoT system, but also significantly enhance the inference accuracy of heterogeneous IoT devices with low communication overhead.},

The onion router (Tor) is a promising method to solve the privacy issue in IoT-based FL by user anonymity. However, IoT devices’ resource is too limited to execute the cryptographic operations in Tor. Moreover, network traffics in Tor can be easily controlled by malicious routers with a fake high self-reported bandwidth. In this article, taking advantage of the Tor, we will introduce an anonymous FL framework in IoT called FedTor. To decrease the cryptographic cost in conventional Tor, we propose a lightweight shared key generation scheme for resource-limited IoT devices. Furthermore, we use the difference between the self-reported bandwidth and the bandwidth observed from others to measure the reputation of onion routers. A reputation-based router selection (RBRS) scheme is then brought up to defend traffic control from malicious routers. We conducted extensive simulations to compare FedTor with related works. The results show that the RBRS scheme can decrease the malicious rate of onion routers and the lightweight shared key has a cost advantage over other schemes.},

However, their comparative training performance under real-world resource-restricted Internet of Things (IoT) device settings remains barely studied. This work provides empirical comparisons of FL and SL in real-world IoT settings regarding (i) learning performance with heterogeneous data distributions and (ii) on-device execution overhead. Our analyses in this work demonstrate that the learning performance of SL is better than FL under an imbalanced data distribution but worse than FL under an extreme non-IID data distribution. Recently, FL and SL are combined to form splitfed learning (SFL) to leverage each of their benefits (e.g., parallel training of FL and lightweight on-device computation requirement of SL). Our work considers FL, SL, and SFL, and mounts them on Raspberry Pi devices to evaluate their performance, including training time, communication overhead, power consumption, and memory usage with resource-restricted IoT devices. Besides evaluations, we apply two optimizations. First, we generalize SFL by carefully examining the possibility of a hybrid type of model training at the server-side. The generalized SFL merges sequential (dependent) and parallel (independent) processes of model training and thus is beneficial to a system with a large scale of IoT devices, specifically at the server-side operations. Second, we propose pragmatic techniques to substantially reduce the communication overhead by up to four times for the SL and (generalized) SFL.},

Among others, dynamic spectrum access (DSA) is one of the most widely accepted approaches. In this paper, as an enhancement of existing works, we take into consideration of inter-node collaborations in a dynamic spectrum environment. Typically, in such distributed circumstances, intelligent dynamic spectrum access almost invariably relies on self-learning to achieve dynamic spectrum access improvement. Whereas, this paper proposes a DSA scheme based on deep reinforcement learning to enhance spectrum and access efficiency. Unlike traditional Q-learning-based DSA, we introduce the following to enhance the spectrum efficiency in dynamic IoT spectrum environments. First, deep double Q-learning is adopted to perform local self-spectrum-learning for IoT terminals in order to achieve better dynamic access accuracy. Second, to accelerate learning convergence, federated learning (FL) in edge nodes is used to improve the self-learning. Third, multiple secondary users, who do not interfere with each other and have similar operation condition, are clustered for federated learning to enhance the efficiency of deep reinforcement learning. Comparing with the traditional distributed DSA with deep learning, the proposed scheme has faster access convergence speed due to the characteristic of global optimization for federated learning. Based on this, a framework of federated deep reinforcement learning (FDRL) for DSA is proposed. Furthermore, this scheme preserves privacy of IoT users in that FDRL only requires model parameters to be uploaded to edge servers. Simulations are performed to show the effectiveness of theproposed FDRL-based DSA framework.},

Besides, uploaded analysing parameters by patients can reveal private information and the threat of direct manipulation by the central server. To address these issues, we present a three-fold Federated Edge Aggregator, the so-called Edge Intelligence, a federated learning-based privacy protection framework for safeguarding Smart Healthcare Systems at the edge against such privacy attacks. We employ an iteration-based Conventional Neural Network (CNN) model and artificial noise functions to balance privacy protection and model performance. A theoretical convergence bound of Edge Intelligence on the trained federated learning model's loss function is also introduced here. We evaluate and compare the proposed framework with the recently established methods using model performance and privacy budget on popular and recent datasets: MNIST, CIFAR10, STL10, and COVID19 chest x-ray. Finally, the proposed framework achieves 90% accuracy and a high privacy rate demonstrating better performance than the baseline technique.},

  abstract     = {Applying federated learning (FL) on Internet of Things (IoT) devices is necessitated by the large volumes of data they produce and growing concerns of data privacy. However, there are three challenges that need to be addressed to make FL efficient: 1) execution on devices with limited computational capabilities; 2) accounting for stragglers due to computational heterogeneity of devices; and 3) adaptation to the changing network bandwidths. This article presents FedAdapt, an adaptive offloading FL framework to mitigate the aforementioned challenges. FedAdapt accelerates local training in computationally constrained devices by leveraging layer offloading of deep neural networks (DNNs) to servers. Furthermore, FedAdapt adopts reinforcement learning (RL)-based optimization and clustering to adaptively identify which layers of the DNN should be offloaded for each individual device on to a server to tackle the challenges of computational heterogeneity and changing network bandwidth. The experimental studies are carried out on a lab-based testbed and it is demonstrated that by offloading a DNN from the device to the server FedAdapt reduces the training time of a typical IoT device by over half compared to classic FL. The training time of extreme stragglers and the overall training time can be reduced by up to 57%. Furthermore, with changing network bandwidth, FedAdapt is demonstrated to reduce the training time by up to 40% when compared to classic FL, without sacrificing accuracy.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) is made up of billions of physical devices connected to the Internet via networks that perform tasks independently with less human intervention. Such brilliant automation of mundane tasks requires a considerable amount of user data in digital format, which, in turn, makes IoT networks an open source of personally identifiable information data for malicious attackers to steal, manipulate, and perform nefarious activities. A huge interest has been developed over the past years in applying machine learning (ML)-assisted approaches in the IoT security space. However, the assumption in many current works is that big training data are widely available and transferable to the main server because data are born at the edge and are generated continuously by IoT devices. This is to say that classic ML works on the legacy set of entire data located on a central server, which makes it the least preferred option for domains with privacy concerns on user data. To address this issue, we propose the federated-learning (FL)-based anomaly detection approach to proactively recognize intrusion in IoT networks using decentralized on-device data. Our approach uses federated training rounds on gated recurrent units (GRUs) models and keeps the data intact on local IoT devices by sharing only the learned weights with the central server of FL. Also, the approach’s ensembler part aggregates the updates from multiple sources to optimize the global ML model’s accuracy. Our experimental results demonstrate that our approach outperforms the classic/centralized machine learning (non-FL) versions in securing the privacy of user data and provides an optimal accuracy rate in attack detection.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) allows predictive model training on the sensed data in a wireless Internet of Things (IoT) network evading data collection cost in terms of energy, time, and privacy. In this article, for an FL setting, we model the learning gain achieved by an IoT device against its participation cost as its utility. The local model quality and the associated cost differ from device to device due to the device heterogeneity, which could be time varying. We identify that this results in utility unfairness because the same global model is shared among the devices. In the vanilla FL setting, the master is unaware of devices’ local model computation and transmission costs, thus, it is unable to address the utility unfairness problem. In addition, a device may exploit this lack of knowledge at the master to intentionally reduce its expenditure and thereby boost its utility. We propose to control the quality of the global model shared with the devices, in each round, based on their contribution and expenditure. This is achieved by employing differential privacy (DP) to curtail global model divulgence based on the learning contribution. Furthermore, we devise adaptive computation and transmission policies for each device to control its expenditure in order to mitigate utility unfairness. Our results show that the proposed scheme reduces the standard deviation of the energy cost of devices by 99% in comparison to the benchmark scheme, while the standard deviation of the training loss of devices varies around 0.103.},

  abstract     = {The computing power of various Internet of Things (IoT) devices is quite different. To enable IoT devices with lower computing power to perform machine learning, all nodes can only train smaller models, which results in the waste of computing power for high-performance devices. In this article, a heterogeneous model fusion federated learning (HFL) mechanism is proposed. Each node trains learning models of different scales according to its own computing capabilities. After receiving the gradient trained by each node, the parameter server (PS) corrects the received gradient with the repeat matrix, and then update the corresponding region of the global model according to the mapping matrix. After all update operations are over, the PS assigns the compressed model to the corresponding node. This article uses a variety of experimental schemes to evaluate the proposed method, including three data sets, two model structures, and three computational complexity levels. The proposed method have been proved it not only maximizes the use of the unbalanced computing power of edge nodes, but also enables different structural models to compensate for the shortcomings of others, improving the overall performance.},

However, anomalies of IIoT devices might expose sensitive data about users of high authenticity and validity, resulting in security and privacy threats to the IIoT applications. That suggests the significance of anomaly detection executed by proper authorities. To address these problems, in this paper, we propose a reliable anomaly detection strategy for IIoT using federated learning. Specifically, we apply the federated learning technique to build a universal anomaly detection model with each local model trained by the deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm. Since local data sets are not required during the federated learning, the chance of privacy leakage is reduced. In addition, by introducing privacy leakage degree and action relation to anomaly detection design, we can greatly improve the detection accuracy. The validation experiments indicate that the proposed strategy achieves high throughput, low latency, and high anomaly detection accuracy for privacy preservation in various IIoT scenarios.},

Since AFL is still in its infancy, it encounters three challenges that need to be resolved jointly, namely: 1) how to rationally utilize AFL clients, whose local data grow gradually, to avoid overlearning issues; 2) how to properly manage the client-server interaction with both communication cost reduced and model performance improved; and finally, 3) how to effectively and efficiently aggregate heterogeneous parameters received at the server to build a global model. To fill the gap, this article proposes a triple-step asynchronous federated learning mechanism (TrisaFed), which can: 1) activate clients with rich information according to an informative client activating strategy (ICA); 2) optimize the client–server interaction by a multiphase layer updating strategy (MLU); and 3) enhance the model aggregation function by a temporal weight fading strategy (TWF), and an informative weight enhancing strategy (IWE). Moreover, based on four standard data sets, TrisaFed is evaluated. As shown by the result, compared with four state-of-the-art baselines, TrisaFed can not only dramatically reduce the communication cost by over 80% but also can significantly improve the learning performance in terms of model accuracy and training speed by over 8% and 70%, respectively.},

However, most of the data collected by the Internet of Things devices in such applications is unlabeled, necessitating the use of semi-supervised learning. Existing studies have introduced solutions to run semi-supervised FL; however, they overlooked the inherent critical impacts of the wireless characteristics at the network edge. We fill this gap by proposing novel solutions to run semi-supervised FL over wireless network edge, considering the limited computation and communication resources and deadline constraints and realizing that unlabeled data can be automatically labeled during the training rounds to improve the performance of the global model. The problem is first formulated as an optimization problem followed by a two-phase solution. In the first phase, we propose a bisection-based algorithm to find the transmit power and local processing speed that optimally fit the new injected labeled data. In the second phase, we propose three algorithms to control the local updates and injected samples that meet the deadline constraint. We analyze the performance of each algorithm concerning the tradeoffs between learning performance, training time, and total energy consumption. Targeting two applications in smart cities, human activity recognition and object detection, we conduct extensive simulations using realistic federated data sets under nonindependent and identically distributed settings. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithms effectively utilize unlabeled samples while accounting for the characteristics of wireless edge networks in smart cities.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL), a cooperative distributed learning framework, has been employed in various intelligent Internet of Things (IoT) applications (e.g., smart health-care, smart home, and smart industry). However, there may be malicious devices in these IoT applications inferring other devices’ privacy or destroying the uploaded model parameters. Besides, due to the heterogeneity of IoT devices, it is difficult for the existing synchronized FL to effectively train models through non-identical independently distributed (non-IID) local data sets. To address these issues, we propose an asynchronous grouped federated learning framework (PAG-FL) for IoT, enabling multiple devices and the server to collaboratively and efficiently train models without revealing privacy. PAG-FL framework consists of an adaptive Rényi Differential Privacy-based privacy budget allocation (ARB) protocol and an asynchronous weight-based grouped update (AWGU) algorithm. In particular, our ARB protocol applies Rényi Differential Privacy and adaptively adjusts the privacy budget to obtain an efficient local model. The AWGU algorithm can defend against the poisoning attack on non-IID data set by weighing grouped local models to generate a global model. Meanwhile, it also realizes the asynchronous optimized update by adopting a lazy loading strategy. Theoretically, the proposed framework has a convergence guarantee and a privacy guarantee when training over the non-IID data set in an asynchronous FL. Our empirical experiments validate the effectiveness of the theoretical design and demonstrate the improved utility and robustness of PAG-FL in heterogeneous IoT.},

In this article, we propose the federated DL (FDL) method for zero-day botnet attack detection to avoid data privacy leakage in IoT-edge devices. In this method, an optimal deep neural network (DNN) architecture is employed for network traffic classification. A model parameter server remotely coordinates the independent training of the DNN models in multiple IoT-edge devices, while the federated averaging (FedAvg) algorithm is used to aggregate local model updates. A global DNN model is produced after a number of communication rounds between the model parameter server and the IoT-edge devices. The zero-day botnet attack scenarios in IoT-edge devices is simulated with the Bot-IoT and N-BaIoT data sets. Experiment results show that the FDL model: 1) detects zero-day botnet attacks with high classification performance; 2) guarantees data privacy and security; 3) has low communication overhead; 4) requires low-memory space for the storage of training data; and 5) has low network latency. Therefore, the FDL method outperformed CDL, localized DL, and distributed DL methods in this application scenario.},

However, federated optimization of the global model in heterogeneous IoT—while considering the heterogeneity among users and limited network constraints—remains to be an open challenge. In this article, we propose a novel adaptive federated optimization algorithm, Adp-FedProx, to achieve the optimal learning performance within the limited computation and communication resources at the edge. In particular, we analyze how the training loss is affected by each user’s global update frequency and the time and energy used for learning by obtaining the novel convergence bound of federated training loss in heterogeneous IoT. With our proposed algorithm, all users can dynamically adjust their number of local iterations in each global interval and will not drop out during the training process for resource exhaustion, so as to impair the negative effect of heterogeneity among users and guarantee the convergence of the training model. In addition, we can get the optimal learning performance by minimizing the gap between the final loss function and the optimal one within limited resources. Finally, extensive numerical results demonstrate the algorithmic advantages in adapting system heterogeneity and admirable performance of the proposed methodologies in speeding up FL 5%–10% and reduce the energy consumption in training about 10% compared with FedProx.},

However, considering the unreliable nature of IoT devices, ensuring the efficiency of FL while protecting the privacy of devices’ input data is a challenging task. To address these issues, we propose a secure aggregation protocol based on efficient additive secret sharing in the fog-computing (FC) setting. As the secure aggregation is performed frequently in the training process of FL, the protocol should have low communication and computation overhead. First, we use a fog node (FN) as an intermediate processing unit to provide local services which can assist the cloud server aggregated the sum during the training process. Second, we design a light Request-then-Broadcast method to ensure our protocol has the robustness to dropped-out clients. Our protocol also provides two simple new client selection methods. The security and performance of our protocol are analyzed and compared with existed schemes. We conduct experiments on high-dimensional inputs, and our experimental results demonstrate about 24– $168\times $  improvement in computation overhead and 87– $287\times $  improvement in communication overhead compared to Google’s secure aggregation protocol (Bonwatiwz et al.

However, averaging model parameters directly to fuse different models at the local clients suffers from client-drift, especially when the training data are heterogeneous across different clients. This leads to slow convergence and degraded learning performance. As a possible solution, we propose the DFL via a mutual knowledge transfer (Def-KT) algorithm, where local clients fuse models by transferring their learned knowledge to each other. Our experiments on the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100 data sets reveal that the proposed Def-KT algorithm significantly outperforms the baseline DFL methods with model averaging, i.e., Combo and FullAvg, especially when the training data are not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) across different clients.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) has played an integral role in Industry 4.0 and produced massive amounts of data for industrial intelligence. These data locate on decentralized devices in modern factories. To protect the confidentiality of industrial data, federated learning (FL) was introduced to collaboratively train shared machine learning (ML) models. However, the local data collected by different devices skew in class distribution and degrade industrial FL performance. This challenge has been widely studied at the mobile edge, but they ignored the rapidly changing streaming data and clustering nature of factory devices, and more seriously, they may threaten data security. In this article, we propose FED GS, which is a hierarchical cloud-edge-end FL framework for 5G empowered industries, to improve industrial FL performance on non-independent and identically distributed (non-j) data. Taking advantage of naturally clustered factory devices, FED GS uses a gradient-based binary permutation algorithm (GBP-CS) to select a subset of devices within each factory and build homogeneous super nodes participating in FL training. Then, we propose a compound-step synchronization protocol to coordinate the training process within and among these super nodes, which shows great robustness against data heterogeneity. The proposed methods are time-efficient and can adapt to dynamic environments, without exposing confidential industrial data in risky manipulation. We prove that FED GS has better convergence performance than FedAvg and give a relaxed condition under which FED GS is more communication efficient. The extensive experiments show that FED GS improves accuracy by 3.5% and reduces training rounds by 59% on average, confirming its superior effectiveness and efficiency on non-i.i.d. data.},

The training data is collected at the devices, also known as FL workers, which collaboratively train a global learning model and share their local model updates with a central entity or server without sharing their data. However, FL can be susceptible to various adversarial attacks that target its security and privacy. In particular, the workers can upload unreliable local model updates, leading to corruption of the main FL task. Workers may intentionally contribute unreliable local updates by launching poisoning attacks or unintentionally by updating low-quality models caused by high device mobility, limited device resources, or unstable network connection. Consequently, identifying reliable and trustworthy workers becomes critical for FL security. In this article, the concept of reputation is adopted as a metric to evaluate workers’ reliability and trustworthiness. In addition, deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based reputation mechanism is proposed for optimal selection and evaluation of reliable FL workers. Due to the dynamic nature of worker behavior in the FL environment, the DRL-based algorithm deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) is employed to improve the FL model accuracy and stability. We compare the performance of our proposed method with a conventional reputation method and deep  $Q$ -networks (DQNs)-based reputation method. Our simulation results demonstrate that our proposed method can improve FL accuracy by more than 30% under various scenarios and achieves better convergence than the other methods.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has been proposed to efficiently and privacy-preserving distributed machine learning architecture for the Internet of Things (IoT). In a wireless FL system, clients in IoT devices train their local models over the local data sets. The derived local models are uploaded to an FL server to generate a global model, broadcasted to the clients in the next global iteration for further training. Owing to the heterogeneous feature of the clients, client selection is critical to determine the overall training time. Traditionally, the objective of client selection is to select the maximum number of clients who can derive and upload their local models before the deadline in each global iteration. However, selecting more clients increases the energy consumption of the clients. Moreover, selecting the maximum number of clients is unnecessary as having fewer clients in early global iterations and more clients in later global iterations have been proved to achieve higher model accuracy. Hence, this article proposes to dynamically adjust and optimize the tradeoff between maximizing the number of selected clients and minimizing the total energy consumption of the clients by selecting suitable clients and allocating appropriate resources in terms of CPU frequency and transmission power. We formulate the joint client selection and resource management problem and design the energy and latency-aware resource management and client selection (ELASTIC) algorithm to efficiently solve the problem. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the performance of ELASTIC.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm through which decentralized devices can collaboratively train a common model. However, a serious concern is the leakage of privacy from exchanged gradient information between clients and the parameter server (PS) in FL. To protect gradient information, clients can adopt differential privacy (DP) to add additional noises and distort original gradients before they are uploaded to the PS. Nevertheless, the model accuracy will be significantly impaired by DP noises, making DP impracticable in real systems. In this work, we propose a novel noise information secretly sharing (NISS) algorithm to alleviate the disturbance of DP noises by sharing negated noises among clients. We theoretically prove that: 1) if clients are trustworthy, DP noises can be perfectly offset on the PS and 2) clients can easily distort negated DP noises to protect themselves in case that other clients are not totally trustworthy, though the cost lowers model accuracy. NISS is particularly applicable for FL across multiple Internet of Things (IoT) systems, in which all IoT devices need to collaboratively train a model. To verify the effectiveness and the superiority of the NISS algorithm, we conduct experiments with the MNIST and CIFAR-10 data sets. The experimental results verify our analysis and demonstrate that NISS can improve model accuracy by 19% on average and obtain better privacy protection if clients are trustworthy.},

  abstract     = {The fast development of the Internet of Things (IoT) and deep learning enables learning useful patterns from the massive amount of collected data with sporadic nodes in IoT systems. Federated learning has received increasing attention in distributed machine learning where only intermediate parameters are exchanged with training samples that resided at local nodes. Nonetheless, most of the existing federated learning schemes assume a homogeneous distribution of data. The assumption, however, does not apply to IoT systems because of the heterogeneity of the IoT architecture. The nonindependent and identical distribution (non-IID) property in data volume and statistical distribution of IoT nodes can impact the performance of an aggregated global model that fits all nodes. Existing federated learning solutions for non-IID data sets either have to train additional models or require extra data exchange to check the node distribution. However, due to resource constraints in IoT systems, these approaches will increase the burden on limited computation capacity and cause network overhead. To address the issue, in this article, a novel weight-similarity-based client clustering (WSCC) approach is proposed, in which clients are split into different groups based on their data set distributions. An affinity-propagation-based method with the cosine distance of the client’s weight parameters is designed to iteratively and automatically determine dynamic clusters. The proposed approach is ideal for IoT systems since there are no auxiliary models and extra data transmissions are needed. Through the theoretical convergence analysis and empirical results, we show that our proposed WSCC scheme outperforms the representative federated learning schemes under different non-IID settings, achieving up to 20% improvements in accuracy.},

However, security and privacy guarantees could be compromised due to malicious participants and the centralized aggregation manner. Possessing attractive features like decentralization, immutability and auditability, Blockchain is promising to enable a tamper-proof and trust-free framework to enhance performance and security in IoT based FL systems. However, directly integrating blockchains into the large scale IoT-based FL scenarios still faces many limitations, such as high computation and storage demands, low transactions throughput, poor scalability and challenges in privacy preservation. This paper proposes  $\mu $ DFL, a novel hierarchical IoT network fabric for decentralized federated learning (DFL) atop of a lightweight blockchain called microchain. Following the hierarchical infrastructure of FL, participants in  $\mu $ DFL are fragmented into multiple small scale microchains. Each microchain network relies on a hybrid Proof of Credit (PoC) block generation and Voting-based Chain Finality (VCF) consensus protocol to ensure efficiency and privacy-preservation at the network of edge. Meanwhile, microchains are federated vie a high-level inter-chain network, which adopts an efficient Byzantine Fault Tolerance (BFT) consensus protocol to achieve scalability and security. A proof-of-concept prototype is implemented, and the experimental results verify the feasibility of the proposed  $\mu $ DFL solution in cross-devices FL settings with efficiency, security and privacy guarantees.},

The healthcare industry is one of the most vulnerable sectors to cyberattacks and data breaches as health data are highly sensitive and distributed in nature. The use of IoT devices with machine learning models to monitor the health status has made the challenge more acute, as it increases the distribution of health data and adds a decentralized structure to healthcare systems. A new privacy-preserving technology, namely, federated learning (FL), is promising for such a challenge as implementing solutions that integrate FL with deep learning, for healthcare applications that rely on IoT, provides several benefits by mainly preserving data privacy, building robust and high accuracy models, and dealing with the decentralized structure, thus achieving sustainability.

Moreover, it proposes an FL algorithm that addresses the local training data acquisition process. Furthermore, it presents an experiment to detect skin diseases using the proposed framework. The extensive results collected show that the DFL models can preserve data privacy without sharing it, maintain the decentralized structure of the system made by IoT devices, improve the area under the curve (AUC) of the model to reach 97%, and reduce the operational costs (OC) for service providers.},

  abstract     = {In recent years, the data available from IoT devices have increased rapidly. Using a machine learning solution to detect faults in these devices requires the release of device data to a central server. However, these data typically contain sensitive information, leading to the need for privacy-preserving distributed machine learning solutions, such as federated learning, where a model is trained locally on the edge device, and only the trained model weights are shared with a central server. Device failure data are typically imbalanced, i.e., the number of failures is minimal compared to the number of normal samples. Therefore, re-balancing techniques are needed to improve the performance of a machine learning model. In this paper, we present FLY-SMOTE, a new approach to re-balance the data in different non-IID scenarios by generating synthetic data for the minority class in supervised learning tasks using a modified SMOTE method. Our approach takes  $k$  samples from the minority class and generates  $Y$  new synthetic samples based on one of the nearest neighbors of each  $k$  sample. An experimental campaign on a real IoT dataset and three well-known public datasets show that the proposed solution improves the balance accuracy without compromising the model’s accuracy.},

We mathematically pinpoint the optimal branching location and the depth of the pruned head model. Apart from the decoupled task training capability, the MTL model offers lesser memory requirements (12.8 MB saving) and better disaster classification accuracy (1-2% gain), while preserving the same detection performance (0.694 of average precision (AP)), as compared to the traditional method. Such advantages of flexibility, speed and accuracy facilitate the large-scale deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) applications, where we explore the potential of federated learning (FL) and active learning (AL). Given the high ambiguity within disaster images, a modified version of AL-based technique is introduced. For realistic implementation, production-ready OpenFL and OpenVINO tools are adopted to update the global FL model and to optimize the trained model, respectively. Experiment results are promising: the FL-based techniques are comparable to or better than their centralized learning (CL) counterparts.

In the system, we designed a new algorithm in which blockchain-assisted compressed algorithm of federated learning is applied for content caching, called CREAT to predict cached files. In the CREAT algorithm, each edge node uses local data to train a model and then uses the model to learn the features of users and files, so as to predict popular files to improve the cache hit rate. In order to ensure the security of edge nodes’ data, we use federated learning (FL) to enable multiple edge nodes to cooperate in training without sharing data. In addition, for the purpose of reducing communication load in FL, we will compress gradients uploaded by edge nodes to reduce the time required for communication. What is more, in order to ensure the security of the data transmitted in the CREAT algorithm, we have incorporated blockchain technology in the algorithm.

In recent years, deep learning (DL) algorithm has been widely used in the field of edge device identification (EDI), and has made great achievements. However, these previous methods are essentially centralized learning-based EDI (CentEDI) that trains all data together, which can not guarantee data security and not conducive to deployment on edge devices.

Experimental results show that the training efficiency of our proposed FedeEDI method is much higher than that of the CentEDI method, although its classification accuracy is slightly reduced. In contrast to the CentEDI method, the proposed FedeEDI method has two main advantages: faster training speed and safer training process.},

As future IoT system will embrace more wireless sensors and devices, the high-performance computing, high-bandwidth and low-latency communication are excessively required, many new research opportunities and challenges for distributed intelligence over Internet of things have arisen. To promote the development of distributed intelligence technology, this special section (SS) focuses on various technologies and platforms regarding industrial IoT systems. This special section received nearly 50 submitted manuscripts, out of which 10 of them have been accepted after a rigorous peer review. Each manuscript is reviewed by multiple rounds of review with at least three or four reviewers, the problems to be solved and the innovation of each manuscript are mainly concerned. Then the accepted papers are summarized as follows in details. Considering the joint optimization of the offloading decision and resource allocation under limited resource constraints in collaborative edge computing networks with multiple IIoT devices and MEC servers, an improved differential evolution algorithm [7] is proposed to minimize the weighted sum of cost of energy consumption and time delay, which can effectively reduce the system delay and energy consumption. In order to improve the performance of task scheduling in cloud computing, Attiya et al. [1] propose a novel hybrid swarm intelligence method MRFOSSA, which uses a modified Manta-Ray Foraging Optimizer (MRFO) and the Salp Swarm Algorithm (SSA). MRFOSSA is superior to other methods in terms of makespan time and cloud throughput. The research goal of the paper [5] is to design an intelligent computing offloading strategy for industrial applications in order to optimize costs and mitigate energy losses. Then the paper proposes to combine a fog controller and AI-based learning techniques so that the fog controller can intelligently assign tasks to the most appropriate fog devices and find the appropriate path to the target. Considering the resource utilization efficiency under dynamic overload requests and network states in IIoT, Chen et al. [2] propose DRL-based intelligent SFC orchestration scheme and jointly optimize the VNF deployment and SFC embedment by the improved DDQN algorithm, which can improve the performance of resource utilization rate, execution cost and delay compared with other representative schemes. To solve the problem of resource allocation and energy cost in Internet of Vehicles, Kong et al. [8] design a joint computing and caching framework and formulate the problem as a reinforcement learning problem to minimize the energy cost. On this basis, the optimization algorithm based on DDPG is proposed, which can effectively decrease energy costs. To reduce the query numbers of the object model when constructing adversarial examples, Zhang et al. [10] propose generating adversarial examples with shadow model (GASM), i.e., transfering the query operations to the designed shadow model, which can achieve high attack success rates. Chen et al. [3] revise a Decentralized-Wireless-Federated-Learning algorithm (DWFL) which utilizes the superposition property of the analog scheme. It can solve the problem of single failure, limited bandwidth resource and privacy protection in wireless federated learning algorithm, which can be applied widely in wireless IoT networks. To reduce the resource consumption in CNN-based applications, Jia et al. [6] propose the CNN-based Resource Optimization APProach which utilizes model compression and computation sharing to optimize inner-model and inter-model respectively, and the comparison results show the superior performance in scalability and the decrease of resource cost. In mobile crowdsensing activities, Gao et al. [4] propose a differential Location Privacy-preserving Mechanism based on Trajectory obfuscation (LPMT) to protect the location privacy of mobile users, which includes three operations: stay points extraction, stay points obfuscation and stay points sampling. In order to mimic the task-free bottom-up visual attention process by predicting salient regions on natural images, Umer et al. [9] propose a Pseudo Knowledge Distillation (PKD) model based on knowledge distillation and pseudo labelling technique, which is computationally efficient and suitable for real-time on-device saliency prediction.},

  abstract     = {Over the past decade, the Internet of Things (IoT) has undergone a paradigm shift away from centralized cloud computing towards edge computing. Hundreds of billions of things are estimated to be deployed in the rapidly advancing IoT paradigm, resulting in enormous amounts of data. Transmitting all these data to the cloud has recently proven to be a performance bottleneck, as it causes many network issues relating to latency, power consumption, security, privacy, etc. However, existing paradigms do not use edge devices for decision making. The use of distributed intelligence could strengthen the IoT in several ways by distributing decision-making tasks to edge devices within the network, rather than sending all data to a central server. In this approach, all computational tasks and data are shared among edge devices. To achieve efficient distribution of IoT intelligence and utilization of network resources, it is necessary to integrate the transport network control with distributed edge and cloud resources to provide dynamic and efficient IoT services. This challenge can be overcome by equipping an edge IoT gateway with the intelligence required to extract information from raw data and to decide whether to actuate itself or to outsource complex tasks to the cloud. Distributed intelligence refers to a collaboration between the cloud and the edge. In this context, we first introduce a distributed SDN-based architecture for IoT that enables IoT gateways to perform IoT processing dynamically at the edge of the network, based on the current state of network resources. Next, we propose an algorithm for selecting clients for the training process of Federated Learning Applications, based on the context information of the network. In the last step, we deploy Federated Learning Applications in our distributed SDN-based architecture, using the gateways to provide distributed intelligence at the edge of the network, and conduct a comprehensive and detailed evaluation of the system from several perspectives.},

Currently, FL is paid more attention by researchers and a growing number of protocols are proposed. This article first analyzes the security vulnerabilities of the VerifyNet and VeriFL protocols, and proposes a new aggregation protocol for FL. We use additive homomorphic encryption and double masking to simultaneously protect the user’s local model and the aggregated global model while most of the existing protocols only consider the privacy of the local model. Also, linear homomorphic hash and digital signature are used to achieve traceable verification, which means the users can not only verify the aggregation results, but also be able to identify the wrong epoch if the results are wrong. In summary, our protocol can realize the privacy of the local model and global model and achieve verification traceability even if the cloud server colludes with malicious users. The experimental results show that the proposed protocol improves the security of FL without decreasing the efficiency of the users and classification accuracy of the training model.},

Meanwhile, in consideration of the huge demands for network access and computing resources from massive IoT devices, ultra-dense edge computing (UDEC), which integrates mobile edge computing (MEC) and ultra-dense network (UDN), has turned out to be a promising network architecture in the era of 5G and even 6G. Facing requirements on ultra-low processing latency, performing FL for UDEC confronts many challenges, one of which is how to relieve the barrel effect caused by the difference in computing power of local devices while ensuring overall FL efficiency. Nevertheless, little work can be found in this area. Toward this end, the paper takes the lead in studying FL for UDEC, and proposes an inter-server collaborative federated learning method by grouping the servers and clients. Theoretical analysis and numerical results corroborate that our proposed inter-server collaborative method can significantly reduce the waiting time during local training without reducing the learning accuracy, thus improving the overall efficiency.},

However, existing log-based anomaly detection approaches that are implemented on large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems generally upload local data from edge devices to a centralized (cloud) server for processing and analysis. Such a workflow incurs significant communication and computation overheads, with potential privacy implications. Hence, in this paper, we propose a customizable and communication-efficient federated anomaly detection scheme (hereafter referred to as FedLog), designed to facilitate the identification of abnormal log patterns in large-scale IoT systems. Specifically, we first craft a Temporal Convolutional Network-Attention Mechanism-based Convolutional Neural Network (TCN-ACNN) model, to effectively extract fine-grained features from system logs. Second, we develop a new federated learning framework to support IoT devices in establishing a comprehensive anomaly detection model in a collaborative and privacy-preserving manner. Third, a lottery ticket hypothesis based masking strategy is designed to achieve customizable and communication-efficient federated learning in handling non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) log datasets. We then evaluate the performance of our proposed scheme with those of DeepLog (published in CCS, 2017) and Loganomaly (published in IJCAI, 2019) in both centralized learning and federated learning settings, using two publicly available and widely used real-world datasets (i.e., HDFS and BGL). The findings demonstrate the utility of the proposed FedLog scheme, in terms of log-based anomaly detection.},

  abstract     = {Artificial intelligence (AI) has witnessed a substantial breakthrough in a variety of Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services, spanning from recommendation systems and speech processing applications to robotics control and military surveillance. This is driven by the easier access to sensory data and the enormous scale of pervasive/ubiquitous devices that generate zettabytes of real-time data streams. Designing accurate models using such data streams, to revolutionize the decision-taking process, inaugurates pervasive computing as a worthy paradigm for a better quality-of-life (e.g., smart homes and self-driving cars.). The confluence of pervasive computing and artificial intelligence, namely Pervasive AI, expanded the role of ubiquitous IoT systems from mainly data collection to executing distributed computations with a promising alternative to centralized learning, presenting various challenges, including privacy and latency requirements. In this context, an intelligent resource scheduling should be envisaged among IoT devices (e.g., smartphones, smart vehicles) and infrastructure (e.g., edge nodes and base stations) to avoid communication and computation overheads and ensure maximum performance. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive survey of the recent techniques and strategies developed to overcome these resource challenges in pervasive AI systems. Specifically, we first present an overview of pervasive computing, its architecture, and its intersection with artificial intelligence. We then review the background, applications and performance metrics of AI, particularly Deep Learning (DL) and reinforcement learning, running in a ubiquitous system. Next, we provide a deep literature review of communication-efficient techniques, from both algorithmic and system perspectives, of distributed training and inference across the combination of IoT devices, edge devices and cloud servers. Finally, we discuss our future vision and research challenges.},

  abstract     = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IoT) typically consists of several thousands of heterogeneous devices, such as sensors, actuators, access points, machinery, end-users' handheld equipment, and supply chain. In such an industrial environment, a multitude of data is generated from massive IoT devices, e.g., sensors for monitoring the environment, reading temperature, and gauging pressure. Most of the data are from delay-sensitive and computation-intensive applications, such as real-time manufacturing and automated diagnostics, which require big data analytics with low latency. Machine learning (ML) has been witnessed as an efficient solution for big data analytics. The majority of such ML algorithms are centralized methods, meaning that they first gather data from different users for use as a training dataset, which is placed on the ML server, and then build a model to classify the new data samples by applying the ML algorithms to this training dataset. However, the access to these datasets in the centralized ML methods raises concerns about data privacy for users. Federated learning (FL) was designed to protect data privacy to address a part of these issues. In FL, each participant uses a global training model without uploading their private data to a third-party server. Compared with the conventional ML, FL can preserve data security, especially in terms of participant data during the learning process. In particular, FL can also help in updating server-side data for the global model, and the participant is not required to provide their data. However, in FL, individual computing units may show abnormal actions, such as faulty software, hardware invasions, unreliable communication channels, and malicious samples deliberately crafting the model. To mitigate these challenges, we require robust policies to control the learning phases in FL. Motivated by the abovementioned issues, this special section solicits original research and practical contributions that advance the security and privacy of the FL solutions for industrial IoT applications as follows.},

We formulate an energy consumption minimization problem in an IRS-assisted federated learning system subject to the completion training time constraint. An iterative resource allocation algorithm is proposed to jointly configure the parameters with proven fast convergence.

In this article, we propose an excellent FL policy for the heterogeneous IoT-edge FL system to improve distributed training efficiency. Specifically, first, by borrowing the idea of clustering, we explore an iterative self-organizing data analysis techniques algorithm (ISODATA)-based heterogeneous-aware client scheduling strategy to alleviate the issue of low training efficiency incurred by the heterogeneity of clients. Subsequently, to tackle the challenge of limited communication resources in FL, we first analyze the characteristics of the optimal resource block allocation solution theoretically and then introduce a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP)-based strategy to judiciously allocate resource blocks for scheduled clients. Comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that, compared with benchmarking strategies, our proposed FL policy can achieve up to 55.22% accuracy improvement in a relaxed time scenario, and attain up to  $3.62\times $  acceleration for reaching the specific expected accuracy.},

However, we argue that, over the course of training, the available clients may exhibit some volatility in terms of the client population, client data, and training status. Considering these volatilities, we propose a new learning scenario termed volatile federated learning (volatile FL) featuring set volatility, statistical volatility, and training volatility. The volatile client set along with the dynamic of clients’ data and the unreliable nature of clients (e.g., unintentional shutdown and network instability) greatly increase the difficulty of client selection. In this article, we formulate and decompose the global problem into two subproblems based on alternating minimization. For an efficient settlement for the proposed selection problem, we quantify the impact of clients’ data and resource heterogeneity for volatile FL and introduce the cumulative effective participation data (CEPD) as an optimization objective. Based on this, we propose upper confidence bound-based greedy selection, dubbed UCB-GS, to address the client selection problem in volatile FL. Theoretically, we prove that the regret of UCB-GS is strictly bounded by a finite constant, justifying its theoretical feasibility. Furthermore, experimental results show that our method significantly reduces the number of training rounds (by up to 62%) while increasing the global model’s accuracy by 7.51%.},

On the one hand, the learning accuracy of FL can be improved by selecting the IoT devices with large data sets for training, which gives rise to a higher energy consumption. On the other hand, the energy consumption can be reduced by selecting the IoT devices with small data sets for FL, resulting in a falling learning accuracy. In this article, we formulate a new resource allocation problem for privacy-preserving EdgeIoT to balance the learning accuracy of FL and the energy consumption of the IoT device. We propose a new FL-enabled twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (FL-DLT3) framework to achieve the optimal accuracy and energy balance in a continuous domain. Furthermore, long short-term memory (LSTM) is leveraged in FL-DLT3 to predict the time-varying network state while FL-DLT3 is trained to select the IoT devices and allocate the transmit power. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FL-DLT3 achieves fast convergence (less than 100 iterations) while the FL accuracy-to-energy consumption ratio is improved by 51.8% compared to the existing state-of-the-art benchmark.},

TinyML allows importing pre-trained ML models on the edge for providing ML-as-a-Service (MLaaS) to IoT devices. This article presents a TinyMLaaS (TMLaaS) architecture for future IoT deployments. The TMLaaS architecture inherently presents several design trade-offs in terms of energy consumption, security, privacy, and latency. We also present how TMLaaS architecture can be implemented, deployed, and maintained for large-scale IoT deployment. The feasibility of implementation for the TMLaaS architecture has been demonstrated with the help of a case study.},

  abstract     = {Over the past few years, fog radio access networks (F-RANs) have become a promising paradigm to support the tremendously increasing demands of multimedia services, by pushing computation and storage functionalities toward the edge of networks, closer to users. In F-RANs, distributed edge caching among fog access points (F-APs) can effectively reduce network traffic and service latency as it places popular contents at local caches of F-APs rather than the remote cloud. Due to the limited caching resources of F-APs and spatiotemporally fluctuant content demands from users, many cooperative caching schemes were designed to decide which contents are popular and how to cache them. However, these approaches often collect and analyze the data from Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices at a central server to predict the content popularity for caching, which raises serious privacy issues. To tackle this challenge, we propose a federated learning-based cooperative hierarchical caching scheme (FLCH), which keeps data locally and employs IoT devices to train a shared learning model for content popularity prediction. FLCH exploits horizontal cooperation between neighbor F-APs and vertical cooperation between the baseband unit (BBU) pool and F-APs to cache contents with different degrees of popularity. Moreover, FLCH integrates a differential privacy mechanism to achieve a strict privacy guarantee. Experimental results demonstrate that FLCH outperforms five important baseline schemes in terms of the cache hit ratio, while preserving data privacy. Moreover, the results show the effectiveness of the proposed cooperative hierarchical caching mechanism for FLCH.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful technology widely applied in Internet of Things (IoT). Recently, researchers have shown an increased interest in privacy-preserving FL with unreliable users. The goal of such works is to achieve private training under ciphertext mode while ensuring that the FL model is mainly derived from the contributions of users with high-quality data. However, the existing work is still in its infancy, and the main challenge faced by many researchers is how to achieve their schemes for meeting the demands of high accuracy and efficiency. To combat that, we propose an efficient privacy-preserving FL (EPPFL) scheme with unreliable users. Specifically, we design a novel scheme to mitigate the negative impact of unreliable users, where the targeted model is guaranteed to be updated with high-quality data. Through iteratively executing our “Excluding Irrelevant Components” and “Weighted Aggregation,” the FL model converges rapidly while taking limited communication and computation overhead. As a result, not only the model accuracy can be optimized, but also the training efficiency can be improved. Meanwhile, we conduct a secure framework based on the threshold Paillier cryptosystem, which can rigorously protect all user-related private information during the training process. Furthermore, the extensive experiments demonstrate our EPPFL with high-level performance in terms of accuracy and efficiency.},

However, the main concern is the potential serious privacy leakage of the system. In this article, we take Alzheimer's disease (AD) as an example and design a convenient and privacy-preserving system named ADDetector with the assistance of Internet of Things (IoT) devices and security mechanisms. Particularly, to achieve effective AD detection, ADDetector only collects user's audio by IoT devices widely deployed in the smart home environment and utilizes novel topic-based linguistic features to improve the detection accuracy. For the privacy breach existing in data, feature, and model levels, ADDetector achieves privacy-preserving by employing a unique three-layer (i.e., user, client, cloud, etc.) architecture. Moreover, ADDetector exploits federated learning (FL) based scheme to ensure the user owns the integrity of raw data and secure the confidentiality of the classification model and implement differential privacy (DP) mechanism to enhance the privacy level of the feature. Furthermore, to secure the model aggregation process between clients and cloud in FL-based scheme, a novel asynchronous privacy-preserving aggregation framework is designed. We evaluate ADDetector on 1010 AD detection trials from 99 health and AD users. The experimental results show that ADDetector achieves high accuracy of 81.9% and low time overhead of 0.7 s when implementing all privacy-preserving mechanisms (i.e., FL, DP, and cryptography-based aggregation).},

Moreover, data and models from clients may become contaminated or damaged, affecting diagnostic performance. To overcome these problems, this study proposes a stacking model for diagnosing interturn short circuit (ITSC) faults in permanent magnet synchronous motors (PMSMs). Federated learning (FL) is used to train the model to increase data security and overcome data islanding in distributed scenarios. Moreover, an improved verification strategy was adopted to select appropriate client models in each round to update the FL global model. We created a secondary server-side data set to validate the client weightings. The data set contains clean sample data for all ITSC fault categories. By calculating the fault diagnosis accuracy of the global model on the auxiliary data set, the model eliminates low-quality clients with uneven fault distributions. The improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) is used to optimize the weight coefficients of clients involved in aggregation, improving the robustness of the aggregation strategy under a joint learning system. In evaluation experiments, compared with the federated average (FedAvg) model, the proposed dynamic verification model exhibited the better diagnostic accuracy in situations of data imbalance, incurred lower communication costs, and prevented local oscillations in the model.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, wireless communication is rapidly reshaping entire industry sectors. In particular, mobile-edge computing (MEC) as an enabling technology for the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) brings a powerful computing/storage infrastructure closer to the mobile terminals and, thereby, significantly lowers the response latency. To reap the benefit of proactive caching at the network edge, precise knowledge on the popularity pattern among the end devices is essential. However: 1) the spatiotemporal variability of content popularity; 2) the data deficiency in privacy-preserving system; 3) the costly manual labels in supervised learning; as well as 4) the not independent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) user behaviors pose tough challenges to the acquisition and prediction of content popularities. In this article, we propose an unsupervised and privacy-preserving popularity prediction framework for MEC-enabled IIoT to achieve a high popularity prediction accuracy while addressing the challenges. Specifically, the concepts of local and global popularities are introduced and the time-varying popularity of each user is modeled as a model-free Markov chain. On this basis, we derive and validate the essential relationship between the local and global popularities and then propose an unsupervised recurrent federated learning (URFL) algorithm to predict the distributed popularity while achieving privacy preservation and unsupervised training. Moreover, a federated loss-weighted averaging (FedLWA) scheme for the parameter aggregation is further designed to alleviate the problem of non-i.i.d. user behaviors. Simulations indicate that the proposed framework can enhance the prediction accuracy in terms of a reduced root-mean-squared error by up to 60.5%–68.7% compared to other baseline methods, i.e., recommendation algorithms, centralized learning algorithms, and other distributed learning algorithms. Additionally, manual labeling and violation of users’ data privacy are both avoided.},

The potential result is that current communication-centric wireless systems are greatly stressed when supporting computation-centric intelligent services with distributed big data. This is one reason that makes federated learning come into being, it allows collaborative training over many edge devices while avoiding the transmission of raw data. To tackle the problem of model aggregation in federated learning systems, this article resorts to multiple reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) to achieve efficient and reliable learning-oriented wireless connectivity. The seamless integration of communication and computation is actualized by over-the-air computation (AirComp), which can be deemed as one of the uplink nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) techniques without individual information decoding. Since all local parameters are uploaded via noisy concurrent transmissions, the unfavorable propagation error inevitably deteriorates the accuracy of the aggregated global model. The goals of this work are to 1) alleviate the signal distortion of AirComp over shared wireless channels and 2) speed up the convergence rate of federated learning. More specifically, both the mean-square error (MSE) and the device set in the model uploading process are optimized by jointly designing transceivers, tuning reflection coefficients, and selecting clients. Compared to baselines, extensive simulation results show that 1) the proposed algorithms can aggregate model more accurately and accelerate convergence and 2) the training loss and inference accuracy of federated learning can be improved significantly with the aid of multiple RISs.},

  abstract     = {The Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) accommodates a huge number of heterogeneous devices to bring vast services under a distributed computing scenarios. Most productive services in IIoT are closely related to production control and require distributed network support with low delay. However, the resource reservation based on gross traffic prediction ignores the importance of productive services and treats them as ordinary services, so it is difficult to provide stable low delay support for large amounts of productive service requests. For many productions, unexpected communication delays are unacceptable, and the delay may lead to serious production accidents causing great losses, especially when the productive service is security related. In this article, we propose a brain-like productive service provisioning scheme with federated learning (BrainIoT) for IIoT. The BrainIoT scheme is composed of three algorithms, including industrial knowledge graph-based relation mining, federated learning-based service prediction, and globally optimized resource reservation. BrainIoT combines production information into network optimization, and utilizes the interfactory and intrafactory relations to enhance the accuracy of service prediction. The globally optimized resource reservation algorithm suitably reserves resources for predicted services considering various resources. The numerical results show that the BrainIoT scheme utilizes interfactory relation and intrafactory relation to make an accurate service prediction, which achieves 96% accuracy, and improves the quality of service.},

The Internet of Things (IoT) is one of the main technologies used to enable smart factories, which is connecting all industrial assets, including machines and control systems, with the information systems and the business processes. Industrial Control Systems of smart IoT-based factories are one of the top industries attacked by numerous threats, especially unknown and novel attacks. As a result, with the distributed structure of plenty of IoT front-end sensing devices in SM, an effectively distributed anomaly detection (AD) architecture for IoT-based ICSs should: achieve high detection performance, train and learn new data patterns in a fast time scale, and have lightweight to be deployed on resource-constrained edge devices. To date, most solutions for anomaly detection have not fulfilled all of these requirements. In addition, the interpretability of why an instance is predicted to be abnormal is hardly concerned. In this paper, we propose the so- called FedeX architecture to address those challenges. The experiments show that FedeX outperforms 14 other existing anomaly detection solutions on all detection metrics with the liquid storage data set. And with Recall of 1 and F1-score of 0.9857, it also outperforms those solutions on the SWAT data set. FedeX is also proven to be fast in terms of training time of about 7.5 minutes and lightweight in terms of hardware requirement with memory consumption of 14%, allowing us to deploy anomaly detection tasks on top of edge computing infrastructure and in real-time. Besides, FedeX is considered as one of the frameworks at the forefront of interpreting the predicted anomalies by using XAI, which enables experts to make quick decisions and trust the model more.},

Meanwhile, the federated model is adversarially trained to prevent this predictive behavior, thus mitigating the poisoning attack influences. We evaluate the poisoning attack and our defense method on three benchmark datasets.

However, this communication protocol can be adopted by attackers to launch data poisoning attacks for different nodes, which has been shown as a big threat to most machine learning models. Therefore, we in this article intend to study the model vulnerability of federated machine learning, and even on IoT systems. To be specific, we here attempt to attacking a popular federated multitask learning framework, which uses a general multitask learning framework to handle statistical challenges in the federated learning setting. The problem of calculating optimal poisoning attacks on federated multitask learning is formulated as a bilevel program, which is adaptive to the arbitrary selection of target nodes and source attacking nodes. We then propose a novel systems-aware optimization method, called as attack on federated learning (AT2FL), to efficiently derive the implicit gradients for poisoned data, and further attain optimal attack strategies in the federated machine learning. This is an earlier work, to our knowledge, that explores attacking federated machine learning via data poisoning. Finally, experiments on several real-world data sets demonstrate that when the attackers directly poison the target nodes or indirectly poison the related nodes via using the communication protocol, the federated multitask learning model is sensitive to both poisoning attacks.},

Inspired by the parameter sharing mechanism, AFL builds a sparse sharing structure by designing an iterative pruning network and generating subnets for each task. Moreover, for better share relevant information, we further propose tailored task mask layers for effectively training specialized subnets, and an adaptive loss function to dynamically adjust the priority between tasks. Extensive experiments show that AFL can successfully fit hundreds of tasks from different devices into one model, which preserves both high accuracy and system scalability, and outperforms other related approaches that naively combine federated learning with multitask learning.},

First, we design a flexible privacy-preserving mechanism for NICE, in which clients can add a Laplace noise into the loss function according to a customized privacy budget. Under this mechanism, we design two incentive utility functions for the server and clients. Next, we model the utility optimization problems as a two-stage Stackelberg game by seeing the server as a leader and the clients as followers. Finally, we derive an optimal Stackelberg equilibrium solution for both the stages of the whole game. Based on this solution, NICE can make the server and all clients achieve their maximum utilities simultaneously. In addition, we conduct extensive simulations on real-world datasets to demonstrate the significant performance of the proposed mechanism.},

In the process of computation offloading in edge computing, it is critical to dynamically make optimal offloading decisions to minimize the delay and energy consumption spent on the devices. Although there are a large number of task offloading-decision models, how to measure and evaluate the quality of different models and configurations is crucial. In this article, we propose a novel simulation platform named ChainFL, which can build an edge computing environment among IoT devices while being compatible with federated learning and blockchain technologies to better support the embedding of security-focused offloading algorithms. ChainFL is lightweight and compatible, and it can quickly build complex network environments by connecting devices of different architectures. Moreover, due to its distributed nature, ChainFL can also be deployed as a federated learning platform across multiple devices to enable federated learning with high security due to its embedded blockchain. Finally, we validate the versatility and effectiveness of ChainFL by embedding a complex offloading-decision model in the platform, and deploying it in an Industrial IoT environment with security risks.},

With the connectivity of sensors, actuators, appliances, and other industrial objects, IIoT enables data availability, improved analytics, and automatic control. Thanks to the complex distributed nature, a wide range of stealthy and evolving cyberattacks become a major threat to the trustworthiness and security of IIoT systems. This makes the standard security procedures unable to assure the trustworthiness of IIoT that protect against cyberattacks. As a remedy, this article presents a blockchain-orchestrated edge intelligence (BoEI) framework that integrates an innovative decentralized federated learning (called Fed-Trust) for cyberattack detection in IIoT. In the Fed-Trust, a temporal convolutional generative network is introduced to enable semi-supervised learning from semi-labeled data. BoEI includes reputation-based blockchain to enable decentralized recording and verification of the transactions for guaranteeing the security and privacy of data and gradients. Fog computing is exploited to offload the block mining operation from the edge side thereby improving the overall computation and communication performance of Fed-Trust. Proof of concept simulations using two public datasets validate the robustness and efficiency of the Fed-Trust over the cutting-edge cyberattack detection approaches.},

At the second stage, Federated Averaging is used by fog devices to create fog models. A global deep model is then created on the cloud using Federated Aggregation. Blockchain is used to record and validate the added models and ensure that records are not altered under cyber-attacks.

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has gained significant importance for intelligent applications, following data produced on a massive scale by numerous distributed IoT devices. From an FL perspective, the key aspect is that this data is not identically and independently distributed (IID) across different data sources and locations. This distribution-skewness leads to significant quality degradation. Moreover, an intrinsic consequence of using such non-IID data in decentralized learning is increasing costs that would be mitigated if using IID data. As a remedy, we propose a resource-efficient method for training an FL-based application with non-IID data, effectively minimizing cost through an auction approach and mitigating quality degradation through data sharing. In an experimental evaluation, we investigate the FL performance using real-world non-IID data and use the resulting ground-truth outputs to develop functions for estimating the utility of non-IID data, computational resource costs, and data generation costs. These functions are used to optimize the costs of model training, ensuring resource efficiency. It is further demonstrated that using shared-IID data significantly increases the resource efficiency of FL with local non-IID data. This holds true even when the shared IID data size is less than 1% of the size of the local non-IID data. Moreover, this work demonstrates that the profitability of the stakeholders can be maximized using the proposed auction procedure. The integration of the auction procedure and a resource-efficient training strategy allows FL service providers to create practical trading strategies by minimizing the FL clients’ resources and payments in a machine learning marketplace.},

Nowadays, with the arrival of the era of big data, the MIoT architecture has been transformed from cloud computing architecture to edge computing architecture. However, due to the lack of trust among edge computing participants, new solutions with higher security need to be proposed. In the current solutions, some use blockchain technology to solve data security problems while some use federated learning technology to solve privacy problems, but these methods neither combine with the special environment of the ocean nor consider the security of task publishers. In this article, we propose a secure sharing method of MIoT data under an edge computing framework based on federated learning and blockchain technology. Combining its special distributed architecture with the MIoT edge computing architecture, federated learning ensures the privacy of nodes. The blockchain serves as a decentralized way, which stores federated learning workers to achieve nontampering and security. We propose a concept of quality and reputation as the metrics of selection for federated learning workers. Meanwhile, we design a quality proof mechanism [proof of quality (PoQ)] and apply it to the blockchain, making the edge nodes recorded in the blockchain more high-quality. In addition, a marine environment model is built in this article, and the analysis based on this model makes the method proposed in this article more applicable to the marine environment. The numerical results obtained from the simulation experiments clearly show that the proposed scheme can significantly improve the learning accuracy under the premise of ensuring the safety and reliability of the marine environment.},

Conventional central methods require that the historical QoS data is centralized. While the QoS data may be distributed in different edge servers. Due to privacy, these edge servers may not be willing to share their data with others for a better model representation. Besides, as each edge server is in charge of the collecting QoS data from the users in a specific area, the QoS data are likely to be heterogeneous. In this article, we propose a personalized federated tensor factorization framework for distributed privacy-preserving IoT services QoS prediction. We first adopt tensors to represent the QoS data with multidimensions and initialize a personalized model for each edge server. Then, each edge server performs local tensor factorization and exchanges the public component with a parameter master. By constraining the consistency of the global public component and the local personalized public components, the global model can learn information from edge servers during the training process. In addition, we conduct extensive experiments on a real-world QoS data set, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework is efficient and effective.},

  abstract     = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has significantly increased the number of terminals and network traffic. It is necessary to exploit the full capacity of the network and optimize content transfer. Despite the powerful processing and storage capabilities of base stations in 5G technology, edge caching effectively reduces content access time and duplicate traffic, thus optimizing content transfer for more storage resources. The limited memory resources and the dynamic nature of the requested content have necessitated the use of smart caching methods. Sending the required data to central servers can cause additional network overload and learning disabilities due to private data. For this reason, a hierarchical federated deep reinforcement learning (HFDRL) is proposed in this article that uses the FDRL method to predict the user’s future requests and to determine the appropriate content replacement strategy. In addition, to perform learning and collaborate caching, the method by which partner devices are determined plays a key role in edge caching performance. HFDRL categorizes edge devices hierarchically, thus avoids the disadvantages of very small or large clusters, takes advantage of both. By minimizing the redundancy of content storage and latency, HFDRL improves the performance for each local base station network individually and the global network. Simulation results of the proposed method show that the hit rate and delay have improved, respectively, by an average of 55% and 67% compared to traditional methods, 40% and 56% compared to the collaborative method, and 14% and 15% compared to one-level FDRL without using hierarchical edge devices clustering.},

  abstract     = {While the emerging 6G networks are anticipated to meet the high-end service quality demands of the mobile edge users in terms of data rate and delay satisfaction, new attack surfaces and zero-day attacks continue to pose significant threats to their successful realization and rollouts. Traditionally, most service provisioning techniques considered security metrics separately from the Quality of Service (QoS) and Quality of Expectation (QoE) parameters. The QoS/QoE parameters include data throughput, experienced delay, tolerable latency, jitter, resource utilization rate, spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, fairness, and other emerging key performance indicators (KPIs). Also, there are various security attributes, such as encryption key strength, authentication strength, network anomaly score, privacy metric, and so on. Typically, the resource allocation optimization techniques to maximize the security aspects to protect the communication of mobile users or user equipment (UEs) have an adverse effect on the service quality. Therefore, a key research gap exists in balancing service quality and security levels in communication networks that has been either overlooked or identified in a rather scattered manner by researchers in the recent decade. Thus, a comprehensive survey of the state-of-the-art to clearly address this research gap and outline the possible solutions is yet to appear in the existing literature. In this paper, we address this by surveying the existing practices, challenges, and opportunities in the emerging 6G (i.e., beyond 5G) networks, where various AI (Artificial Intelligence)-based techniques such as deep learning meet the classical optimization techniques, to balance the service performance and security levels. Several networking topologies with relevant use-cases are included in the survey to discuss the existing and emerging trends of isolated as well as joint treatment of service and security levels. Lessons learned from each use-case are provided to demonstrate a clear road map for the interested readers and researchers in emerging networks to construct a natively combined service and security ecosystem, specifically in the network edge.},

In conventional AI of Things (AIoT) paradigms, a wealth of individual energy data distributed across users’ IoT devices needs to be migrated to a central storage (e.g., cloud or edge device) for knowledge extraction, which may impose severe privacy violation and data misuse risks. Federated learning, as an appealing privacy-preserving AI paradigm, enables energy data owners (EDOs) to cooperatively train a shared AI model without revealing the local energy data. Nevertheless, potential security and efficiency concerns still impede the deployment of federated-learning-based AIoT services in smart grids due to the low-quality shared local models, non-independently and identically distributed (non-IID) data distributions, and unpredictable communication delays. In this article, we propose a secure and efficient federated-learning-enabled AIoT scheme for private energy data sharing in smart grids with edge-cloud collaboration. Specifically, we first introduce an edge-cloud-assisted federated learning framework for communication-efficient and privacy-preserving energy data sharing of users in smart grids. Then, by considering non-IID effects, we design a local data evaluation mechanism in federated learning and formulate two optimization problems for EDOs and energy service providers. Furthermore, due to the lack of knowledge of multidimensional user private information in practical scenarios, a two-layer deep reinforcement-learning-based incentive algorithm is developed to promote EDOs’ participation and high-quality model contribution. Extensive simulation results show that the proposed scheme can effectively stimulate EDOs to share high-quality local model updates and improve the communication efficiency.},

However, the traditional centralized learning approach (CL), which centralizes the data resources of different shipping companies to a cloud server for model training, is restricted in real industrial scenarios due to privacy concerns and business competitions. In this article, we propose a novel adaptive privacy-preserving federated learning approach, named AdaPFL, for fault diagnosis in IoS, which can organize different shipping agents to collaboratively develop a model by sharing model parameters with no risk of data leakage. First, we use two common tasks as examples to demonstrate that a small part of the model parameters might reveal the shipping agents’ raw information. Based on this, the Paillier-based communication scheme is designed to preserve the raw information of the shipping agents. Furthermore, to deal with the harsh marine environment, a control algorithm is proposed to adaptively change the model aggregation interval during the training process for reducing cryptography computation and communication costs. Theoretical analysis and experiments prove the high effectiveness of the AdaPFL on a real nonindependent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d) fault data set.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning using fog computing can suffer from the dynamic behavior of some of the participants in its training process, especially in Internet-of-Vehicles where vehicles are the targeted participants. For instance, the fog might not be able to cope with the vehicles’ demands in some areas due to resource shortages when the vehicles gather for events, or due to traffic congestion. Moreover, the vehicles are exposed to unintentionally leaving the fog coverage area which can result in the task being dropped as the communications between the server and the vehicles weaken. The aforementioned limitations can affect the federated learning model accuracy for critical applications, such as autonomous driving, where the model inference could influence road safety. Recent works in the literature have addressed some of these problems through active sampling techniques, however, they suffer from many complications in terms of stability, scalability, and efficiency of managing the available resources. To address these limitations, we propose a horizontal-based federated learning architecture, empowered by fog federations, devised for the mobile environment. In our architecture, fog computing providers form stable fog federations using a Hedonic game-theoretical model to expand their geographical footprints. Hence, providers belonging to the same federations can migrate services upon demand in order to cope with the federated learning requirements in an adaptive fashion. We conduct the experiments using a road traffic signs dataset modeled with intermodal traffic systems. The simulation results show that the proposed model can achieve better accuracy and quality of service than other models presented in the literature.},

However, sharing data is full of challenges due to the increasing demands of privacy and security with the growing use of smart mobile devices and Internet of thing (IoT) devices. Federated learning provides a potential solution to privacy-preserving and secure machine learning, by means of jointly training a global model without uploading data distributed on multiple devices to a central server. However, most existing work on federated learning adopts machine learning models with full-precision weights, and almost all these models contain a large number of redundant parameters that do not need to be transmitted to the server, consuming an excessive amount of communication costs. To address this issue, we propose a federated trained ternary quantization (FTTQ) algorithm, which optimizes the quantized networks on the clients through a self-learning quantization factor. Theoretical proofs of the convergence of quantization factors, unbiasedness of FTTQ, as well as a reduced weight divergence are given. On the basis of FTTQ, we propose a ternary federated averaging protocol (T-FedAvg) to reduce the upstream and downstream communication of federated learning systems. Empirical experiments are conducted to train widely used deep learning models on publicly available data sets, and our results demonstrate that the proposed T-FedAvg is effective in reducing communication costs and can even achieve slightly better performance on non-IID data in contrast to the canonical federated learning algorithms.},

  abstract     = {This article studies decentralized federated learning algorithms in wireless IoT networks. The traditional parameter server architecture for federated learning faces some problems such as low fault tolerance, large communication overhead and inaccessibility of private data. To solve these problems, we propose a decentralized wireless federated learning algorithm called DWFL. The algorithm works in a system where the workers are organized in a peer-to-peer and server-less manner, and the workers exchange their privacy preserving data with the analog transmission scheme over wireless channels in parallel. With rigorous analysis, we show that DWFL satisfies $(\epsilon,\delta)$-differential privacy and the privacy budget per worker scales as $\mathcal {O}(\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}})$, in contrast with the constant budget in the orthogonal transmission approach. Furthermore, DWFL converges at the same rate of $\mathcal {O}(\sqrt{\frac{1}{TN}})$ as the best known centralized algorithm with a central parameter server. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our algorithm DWFL also performs well in real settings.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) enables data owners to train a global model with shared gradients while keeping private training data locally. However, recent research demonstrated that the adversary may infer private training data of clients from the exchanged local gradients, e.g., having deep leakage from gradients (DLGs). Many existing privacy-preserving approaches take usage of differential privacy (DP) to guarantee privacy. Nevertheless, the widely used privacy budget of DP (e.g., evenly distribution) leads to a sharp decline of model accuracy. To improve the model accuracy, some schemes only consider allocating the privacy budget to the fully connected layers. However, we reveal that the adversary may still reconstruct the private training data by adopting the DLG attack with the gradients of convolutional layers. In this article, we propose a fine-grained DP federated learning (DPFL) scheme, which guarantees privacy and remains high model performance simultaneously. Specifically, inspired by the methods that measure the importance of layers in deep learning, we propose a fine-grained method to allocate noise according to the importance value of layers in order to remain high model performance. Besides, we combine an active client selection strategy with DPFL and perform fine-tuning with a public data set on the server to further ensure the model performance. We evaluate DPFL under both independent and identically distributed (i.i.d) and non-i.i.d data settings to show that our method can achieve similar accuracy as the plain FL (e.g., FedAvg). We also demonstrate that our DPFL can resist the DLG attack to verify its privacy guarantee.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning framework, where multiple distributed edge Internet of Things (IoT) devices collaboratively train a model under the orchestration of a central server while keeping the training data distributed on the IoT devices. FL can mitigate the privacy risks and costs from data collection in traditional centralized machine learning. However, the deployment of standard FL is hindered by the expense of the communication of the gradients from the devices to the server. Hence, many gradient compression methods have been proposed to reduce the communication cost. However, the existing methods ignore the structural correlations of the gradients and, therefore, lead to a large compression loss which will decelerate the training convergence. Moreover, many of the existing compression schemes do not enable over-the-air aggregation and, hence, require huge communication resources. In this work, we propose a gradient compression scheme, named FedOComp, which leverages the correlations of the stochastic gradients in FL systems for efficient compression of the high-dimension gradients with over-the-air aggregation. The proposed design can achieve a smaller deceleration of the training convergence compared to other gradient compression methods since the compression kernel exploits the structural correlations of the gradients. It also directly enables over-the-air aggregation to save communication resources. The derived convergence analysis and simulation results further illustrate that under the same power cost, the proposed scheme has a much faster convergence rate and higher test accuracy compared to existing baselines.},

  abstract     = {Industry 5.0 is rapidly growing as the next industrial evolution, aiming to improve production efficiency in the 21st century. This evolution relies mainly on advanced digital technologies, including Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), by deploying multiple IIoT devices within industrial systems. Such a setup increases the possibility of threats, especially with the emergence of IIoT botnets. This can provide attackers with more sophisticated tools to conduct devastating IIoT attacks. Besides, machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) are considered as powerful techniques to efficiently detect IIoT attacks. However, the centralized way in building learning models and the lack of up-to-date datasets that contain the main attacks are still ongoing challenges. In this context, multiaccess edge computing (MEC) and federated learning (FL) are two promising complementary technologies. MEC brings computing capabilities at the edge of the industrial systems, while FL leverages the edge resources to enable a privacy-aware collaborative learning, especially in multiindustrial systems context. In this article, we design a novel MEC-based framework to secure IIoT applications leveraging FL, called FedGame. Specifically, FedGame enables multiple MEC domains to collaborate securely to deal with an IIoT attack, while preserving the privacy of IIoT devices. Moreover, a noncooperative game is formulated on the top of FedGame, to enable MEC nodes acquiring the needed virtual resources from the centralized MEC orchestrator, to deal with each type of IIoT attacks. We evaluate FedGame using real-world IIoT attacks; the experimental results show not only the accuracy of FedGame against centralized ML/DL schemes while preserving the privacy of Industrial systems but also its efficiency in providing required MECs resources and, thus, dealing with IIoT attacks.},

Billions of AIoT devices around the world are now connected to the Internet. This widespread deployment of AIoT devices presents huge challenges for the centralized AI training architecture (e.g., security issues, privacy issues). Recently, with the advance of federated learning (FL) technology, the integration of AIoT and FL is considered as a promising solution. FL enables distributed devices to collaboratively train a shared AI model while keeping all the training data contained in local. However, unlike the centralized architecture, the distributed learners are independent, uncontrollable, and self-interested. Designing effective incentive schemes to stimulate the distributed devices to actively participate in training tasks and contribute high-quality training models is the priority question. In this paper, we design a double auction mechanism for FL service market, where the trained models can be automatically traded between AIoT devices and FL platforms. Then, we propose an iterative double auction (IDA) algorithm, where a controller is implemented to guide participants to adjust their policies for the sake of maximizing individual participates utilities as well as social welfare. In addition, we propose a reinforcement learning-based scheme, termed as the Experience Weighted Attraction Learning-Double Auction (EWA-DA) algorithm. In EWA-DA, the participants can learn to improve their strategies directly by participating in the auction continuously, without the controller participating.},

  abstract     = {As a promising distributed learning technology, analog aggregation-based federated learning over the air (FLOA) provides high communication efficiency and privacy provisioning under the edge computing paradigm. When all edge devices (workers) simultaneously upload their local updates to the parameter server (PS) through commonly shared time-frequency resources, the PS obtains the averaged update only rather than the individual local ones. While such a concurrent transmission and aggregation scheme reduces the latency and communication costs, it unfortunately renders FLOA vulnerable to Byzantine attacks. Aiming at Byzantine-resilient FLOA, this article starts from analyzing the channel inversion (CI) mechanism that is widely used for power control in FLOA. Our theoretical analysis indicates that although CI can achieve good learning performance in the benign scenarios, it fails to work well with limited defensive capability against Byzantine attacks. Then, we propose a novel scheme called the best effort voting (BEV) power control policy that is integrated with stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Our BEV-SGD enhances the robustness of FLOA to Byzantine attacks, by allowing all the workers to send their local updates at their maximum transmit power. Under worst-case attacks, we derive the expected convergence rates of FLOA with CI and BEV power control policies, respectively. The rate comparison reveals that our BEV-SGD outperforms its counterpart with CI in terms of better convergence behavior, which is verified by experimental simulations.},

It is extremely urgent to build a unified urban brain, and the core issue is data sharing and fusion. Aiming at the problems of data island, data leakage, and high trust cost in the IoT of the smart city, a lightweight and trusted sharing mechanism (LTSM) is proposed. First, the blockchain is combined with federated learning to realize the data sharing, which not only protects the private data, but also ensures the sharing process trust. Then, a node selection algorithm based on credit value and a node evaluation algorithm based on smart contract are designed to improve the quality of federated learning. Finally, we propose an improved raft consensus to meet the delay and security requirements of the consortium blockchain in the smart city scenario. In the simulation, we evaluate the federated learning algorithm, the node selection algorithm, and the improved raft consensus, respectively. The experimental results show that the LTSM mechanism has a good application value. The federated learning model has a better accuracy, but its training time is also longer. The node selection algorithm is helpful to improve the accuracy of the federated learning model. The improved raft consensus improves the throughput.},

To cope with data heterogeneity, an iterative federated clustering algorithm (IFCA) has been proposed. IFCA partitions the clients into a number of clusters and lets the clients in the same cluster optimize a shared model. However, in IFCA, the clusters are nonoverlapping, which leads to an inefficient utilization of the local information since the knowledge of a client is used by only one cluster during each round. To capture the complex nature of real-world data, soft clustering methods with overlapping clusters have been proposed that attain superior performance over the hard ones. Motivated by this, we propose a new algorithm named FL with soft clustering (FLSC) by combining the strengths of soft clustering and IFCA, where the clients are partitioned into overlapping clusters and the information of each participating client is used by multiple clusters simultaneously during each round. The experimental results show that FLSC achieves better learning performance on the classification tasks on the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST data sets, compared with the state-of-the-art baseline methods, i.e., the global model method and IFCA.},

Nevertheless, such analysis on image classification tasks is not applicable to uncover the privacy threats against natural language processing (NLP) tasks, whose records composed of sequential texts cannot be grouped as class representatives. The finer (record-level) granularity in NLP tasks not only makes it more challenging to extract individual text records, but also exposes more serious threats. This article presents the first attempt to explore the record-level privacy leakage against NLP tasks in FL. We propose a framework to investigate the exposure of the records of interest in federated aggregations by leveraging the perplexity of language modeling. Through monitoring the exposure patterns, we propose two correlation attacks to identify the corresponding clients when extracting their specific records. Extensive experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed attacks. We have also examined several countermeasures and shown that they are ineffective to mitigate such attacks, and hence further research is expected.},

This is achieved by simultaneously exploiting the channel propagation reconfigurability with RIS for boosting the received signal power, as well as the waveform superposition property with over-the-air computation (AirComp) for fast model aggregation. By considering a practical scenario, where high-dimensional local model updates are transmitted across multiple communication blocks, we characterize the convergence behaviors of the differentially private federated optimization algorithm. We further formulate a system optimization problem to optimize the learning accuracy while satisfying privacy and power constraints via the joint design of transmit power, artificial noise, and phase shifts at RIS, for which a two-step alternating minimization framework is developed. Simulation results validate our systematic, theoretical, and algorithmic achievements and demonstrate that RIS can achieve a better tradeoff between privacy and accuracy for over-the-air FL systems.},

While CPSS offer a wide variety of data from wearable devices, challenges such as data silos and secure data sharing still remain. In this study, a 2-Dimensional Federated Learning (2DFL) framework, including the vertical and horizontal federated learning phases, is designed to cope with the insufficient training data and insecure data sharing issues in CPSS during a secure distributed learning process. Considering a specific application of Human Activity Recognition (HAR) across a variety of different devices from multiple individual users, the vertical federated learning scheme is developed to integrate shareable features from heterogeneous data across different devices into a full feature space, while the horizontal federated learning scheme is developed to effectively aggregate the encrypted local models among multiple individual users to achieve a high-quality global HAR model. A computationally efficient somewhat homomorphic encryption (SWHE) scheme is then improved and applied to support the parameter aggregation without giving access to it, which enables heterogeneous data sharing with privacy protection across different personal devices and multiple users in building a more precise personalized HAR model. Experiments are conducted based on two public datasets. Comparing with three conventional machine learning methods, evaluation results demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of our proposed model in achieving faster and smoother convergence, with better precision, recall, and F1 scores for HAR applications in CPSS.},

To address this problem, the federated opportunistic computing for ubiquitous system (FOCUS) has been proposed very recently. In FOCUS, the central server utilizes its accurately labeled benchmark samples to quantify the credibility of different clients by computing the cross-entropy (CE) loss of the locally updated models on the benchmark data set and the CE loss of the global model on the local data sets. However, FOCUS assumes the availability of the accurate labels of the benchmark data set, which is difficult to guarantee under many practical scenarios. To overcome this limitation of FOCUS, we propose a new algorithm named robust federated opportunistic learning (RFOL), which does not require the benchmark samples at the central server to be labeled. In RFOL, the client credibility is evaluated by computing the Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence among the soft predictions on the benchmark samples of different locally updated models and the CE loss of the global model on the local data sets. The experimental results on several popular data sets reveal that: 1) with an unlabeled benchmark data set at the server, the proposed RFOL algorithm attains almost the same learning performance as FOCUS, which requires an accurately labeled benchmark data set at the server; 2) with an inaccurately labeled benchmark data set, RFOL outperforms FOCUS, which shows that the former is more robust to the inaccurate labels of the benchmark samples; and 3) RFOL outperforms FedAvg, which assigns equal credibility to all the clients.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is widely adopted in traffic forecasting tasks involving large-scale IoT-enabled sensor data since its decentralization nature enables data providers’ privacy to be preserved. When employing state-of-the-art deep learning-based traffic predictors in FL systems, the existing FL frameworks confront overlarge communication overhead when transmitting these models’ parameter updates since the modeling depth and breadth renders them incorporating an enormous number of parameters. In this article, we propose a practical FL scheme, namely, Clustering-based hierarchical and Two-step-optimized FL (CTFed), to tackle this issue. The proposed scheme follows a divide et impera strategy that clusters the clients into multiple groups based on the similarity between their local models’ parameters. We integrate the particle swarm optimization algorithm and devises a two-step approach for local model optimization. This scheme enables only one but representative local model update from each cluster to be uploaded to the central server, thus reduces the communication overhead of the model updates transmission in FL. CTFed is orthogonal to the gradient compression- or sparsification-based approaches so that they can orchestrate to optimize the communication overhead. Extensive case studies on three real-world data sets and three state-of-the-art models demonstrate the outstanding training efficiency, accurate prediction performance, and robustness to unstable network environments of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) enables smart devices to collaboratively train Machine Learning (ML) models in a distributed manner without sharing their private data with a central server. However, the disparity between the communication and computation capabilities, and the heterogeneity of local datasets of smart devices degrades the performance of FL in terms of latency and accuracy. To mitigate this effect, we address the problems of device selection and resource allocation in an indoor environment where multiple smart devices participate in the FL process. To further reduce the communication latency, we use Visible Light Communication (VLC) for the downlink transmission while a Radio Frequency (RF) access point supports the uplink transmission in the proposed system. Accordingly, we formulate a multi-objective optimization problem for joint device selection and resource allocation in a hybrid VLC/RF system. Then, using the weight methods, the problem is converted to a single-objective optimization which is solved by incrementally selecting devices in each iteration. The embedded device selection scheme in the proposed algorithm is based on the significance of candidate devices’ local gradients and their alignment with the global tendency in order to intelligently prioritize the candidates in the training procedure. Simulation results show that the joint device selection and resource allocation scheme improves the accuracy of the ML model and reduces the average delay in presence of both system and data heterogeneity. Additionally, the proposed hybrid VLC/RF system decreases the latency of the FL process in the downlink mode compared to conventional RF systems.},

  abstract     = {To facilitate the implementation of deep learning-based vehicular applications, vehicular federated learning is introduced by integrating vehicular edge computing with the newly emerged federated learning technology. In vehicular federated learning, it is widely considered that the raw data collected by vehicles have complete ground-truth labels. This, however, is not realistic and inconsistent with the current applications. To deal with the above dilemma, a semisupervised vehicular federated learning (Semi-VFL) framework is proposed. In the framework, each vehicular client uses labeled data shared by an application provider, and its own unlabeled data to cooperatively update a global deep neural network model. Furthermore, the application provider combines the multidimensional contract theory with prospect theory (PT) to design an incentive mechanism to stimulate appropriate vehicular clients to participate in Semi-VFL. Multidimensional contract theory is used to deal with the information asymmetry scenario where the application provider is not aware of vehicular clients’ 3-D cost information, while PT is used to model the application provider’s risk-aware behavior and make the incentive mechanism more acceptable in practice. After that, a closed-form solution for the optimal contract items under PT is derived. We present the real-world experimental results to demonstrate that Semi-VFL achieves the advantages in both the test accuracy and convergence speed, in comparison with existing baseline schemes. Based on the experimental results, we further perform the simulations to verify that our incentive mechanism is efficient.},

  abstract     = {In smart grids, a major challenge is how to effectively utilize consumers’ energy consumption data while preserving security and privacy. In this article, we tackle this challenging issue and focus on energy theft detection, which is very important for smart grids. Specifically, we note that most existing energy theft detection schemes are centralized, which may be unscalable, and more importantly, may be very difficult to protect data privacy. To address this issue, we propose a novel privacy-preserving federated learning framework for energy theft detection, namely, FedDetect. In our framework, we consider a federated learning system that consists of a data center (DC), a control center (CC), and multiple detection stations. In this system, each detection station (DTS) can only observe data from local consumers, which can use a local differential privacy (LDP) scheme to process their data to preserve privacy. To facilitate the training of the model, we design a secure protocol so that detection stations can send encrypted training parameters to the CC and the DC, which then use homomorphic encryption to calculate the aggregated parameters and return updated model parameters to detection stations. In our study, we prove the security of the proposed protocol with solid security analysis. To detect energy theft, we design a deep learning model based on the state-of-the-art temporal convolutional network (TCN). Finally, we conduct extensive data-driven experiments using a real-energy consumption data set. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed federated learning framework can achieve high accuracy of detection with a smaller computation overhead.},

  abstract     = {Real-time environment monitoring is a key application in Industrial Internet of Things, where sensors proactively collect and transmit environmental data to the controller. However, due to limited wireless resources, keeping sensors’ sampled data fresh at the controller is critical. This work aims to investigate the trade-off between the sensor’s data-sampling frequency and long-term data transmission energy consumption while maintaining information freshness. Leveraging the entropic risk measure (ERM), we jointly minimize the global transmission energy’s mean and variance subject to probabilistic constraints on information freshness. Furthermore, while jointly saving the model training energy, we adopt the federated learning (FL) paradigm and propose an FL-based two-stage iterative optimization framework to optimize the aforementioned objective. Specifically, we iteratively learn the sampling frequency via Bayesian optimization and minimize the long-term ERM of the global energy consumption via Lyapunov optimization. Numerical results show that the proposed FL-based scheme saves substantial executing energy with less performance loss. Quantitatively, compared with the centralized learning baseline, the proposed FL-based framework saves up to 69% model training energy at the expense of a mere increased objective outcome, i.e., 6.3% in the global data transmission energy consumption ( $9.936\times 10^{-5}$  in ERM) under 0.4% bias from the global optimal data-sampling frequency.},

With the abundant user health data accessed by Internet of Things (IoT) devices and recent development in machine learning, smart healthcare has seen many successful stories. However, existing approaches for in-home health monitoring do not pay sufficient attention to user data privacy and thus are far from being ready for large-scale practical deployment. In this paper, we propose FedHome, a novel cloud-edge based federated learning framework for in-home health monitoring, which learns a shared global model in the cloud from multiple homes at the network edges and achieves data privacy protection by keeping user data locally. To cope with the imbalanced and non-IID distribution inherent in user’s monitoring data, we design a generative convolutional autoencoder (GCAE), which aims to achieve accurate and personalized health monitoring by refining the model with a generated class-balanced dataset from user’s personal data. Besides, GCAE is lightweight to transfer between the cloud and edges, which is useful to reduce the communication cost of federated learning in FedHome. Extensive experiments based on realistic human activity recognition data traces corroborate that FedHome significantly outperforms existing widely-adopted methods.},

  abstract     = {Due to the strong analytical ability of big data, deep learning has been widely applied to model on the collected data in industrial Internet of Things (IoT). However, for privacy issues, traditional data-gathering centralized learning is not applicable to industrial scenarios sensitive to training sets, such as face recognition and medical systems. Recently, federated learning has received widespread attention, since it trains a model by only sharing gradients without accessing training sets. But existing research works reveal that the shared gradient still retains the sensitive information of the training set. Even worse, a malicious aggregation server may return forged aggregated gradients. In this article, we propose the VFL, a verifiable federated learning with privacy-preserving for big data in industrial IoT. Specifically, we use Lagrange interpolation to elaborately set interpolation points for verifying the correctness of the aggregated gradients. Compared with existing schemes, the verification overhead of VFL remains constant regardless of the number of participants. Moreover, we employ the blinding technology to protect the privacy of the privacy gradients. If no more than $\boldsymbol{n}$-2 of $\boldsymbol{n}$ participants collude with the aggregation server, VFL could guarantee the encrypted gradients of other participants not being inverted. Experimental evaluations corroborate the practical performance of the presented VFL with high accuracy and efficiency.},

Numerical results show that the proposed rate-splitting transmission achieves notable gains over benchmark schemes which rely solely on edge or cloud decoding.},

The privacy risk for a peer is that the model update she computes on her private data may, when sent to the model manager, leak information on those private data. Even more obvious are security attacks, whereby one or several malicious peers return wrong model updates in order to disrupt the learning process and lead to a wrong model being learned. In this article, we build a federated learning framework that offers privacy to the participating peers as well as security against the Byzantine and poisoning attacks. Our framework consists of several protocols that provide strong privacy to the participating peers via unlinkable anonymity and that are rationally sustainable based on the co-utility property. In other words, no rational party is interested in deviating from the proposed protocols. We leverage the notion of co-utility to build a decentralized co-utile reputation management system that provides incentives for parties to adhere to the protocols. Unlike privacy protection via differential privacy, our approach preserves the values of model updates and, hence, the accuracy of plain federated learning; unlike privacy protection via update aggregation, our approach preserves the ability to detect bad model updates while substantially reducing the computational overhead compared to methods based on homomorphic encryption.},

The introduction of this device in wireless communications aids in reducing the hardware requirements, energy consumption, and signal processing complexity. The integration of this device with various emerging technologies such as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) technique, physical layer security, etc., has increased its potentiality in terms of performance enhancement. One such integration could be studied, i.e. RIS-assisted unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The UAVs exhibit aiding capability in various services to our society such as real-time data collection, traffic monitoring, military operations & surveillance, medical assistance, and goods delivery. Despite the positive appeal, the UAV has its limitations such as fuel efficacy, environment disturbances, limited network capability, etc. Considering these scenarios, the RIS can provide assistance to UAVs to enhance their performance when integrated. There is a limited number of articles and researches that consider UAV-assisted RIS systems. This article provides a detailed survey on RIS-assisted UAV systems considering multiple contexts such as optimization, communication techniques, deep reinforcement learning, secrecy performance, efficiency enhancement, and the internet of things.

For example, smart data markets help to predict crimes or understand the cause of COVID-19 infections. For these smart services, the users agree to the privacy policy so that the personal and sensitive information can be collected by a third party. But the conditions of the privacy policy do not specify whether the information of the users can be tracked. To ensure data transparency, many systems are applying consortium/private blockchains with raft algorithm. The raft algorithm requires nodes to check countless messages for a single transaction. Eventually, as the number of nodes increases, the overall system degradation is derived from the burden of the leader node. This paper proposes a method to process the collected transactions by dividing a certain amount of transactions into cells, without any extra protocol. The proposed scheme also uses the federated learning model with high accuracy and data privacy, in order to determine the optimized cell size in a blockchain system that should lead to consensus on multiple servers. Therefore, the proposed CBR (Cell-based Raft) consensus algorithm proposes a protocol that reduces the number of messages, without interfering with the concept of the existing raft algorithm, in order to maintain stable throughput in the smart data market where massive transactions occur.},

However, the existing FL literature focuses on speeding up the learning process and ignores minimizing the communication cost which is critical for resource-constrained clients. To this end, in this article, we propose a novel 3-way hierarchical framework (THF) to promote communication efficiency in FL. Using the proposed framework, only a cluster head (CH) communicates with the cloud server through edge aggregation in order to minimize the communication cost of clients. In particular, the clients upload their local models to their respective CHs, which are responsible to forward them to the corresponding edge server. The edge server averages the local models and iterates until it achieves the edge accuracy. Afterward, each edge server uploads the edge models to the cloud server for global aggregation. In this way, model downloading and uploading requires less bandwidth due to the short distance from source to destination that makes an efficient 3-way hierarchical network structure. In addition, we formulate a joint communication and computation resource management scheme through efficient client selection in order to achieve global cost minimization in FL. We conduct extensive empirical evaluations on diverse data learning tasks on multiple data sets to signify that THF achieves global cost savings and converges within fewer communication rounds compared to other FL approaches.},

Thereby, blockchain-based federated learning has emerged to protect Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) devices from exposing their private data by the Federated Learning (FL) framework, and also enables decentralized model training without the vulnerability of a central server. However, the existing blockchain-based FL systems still suffer from (i) limited scalability of the single blockchain framework; and (ii) large communication costs incurred by iterative large-size model update transmission. To this end, we first design an efficient cross-chain framework for scalable and flexible model training management, in which multiple blockchains are customized for specific FL tasks and individually perform learning tasks for privacy protection. A cross-chain scheme is proposed to enable secure blockchain collaboration and interactions for efficient model training, model trading, and payment. We then propose a flexible model update compression scheme to save communication costs almost without compromising accuracy. Moreover, for model trading markets, we design a dynamic pricing scheme using machine learning-based auction for model trading. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework and schemes achieve scalable, flexible, and communication-efficient decentralized FL systems in AIoT.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning is an emerging paradigm to conduct the machine learning collaboratively but avoid the leakage of original data. Then, how to motivate the data owners to participate federated learning and contribute high-quality data is the crucial issue. In this article, a blockchain-based federated learning (BFL) with a reputation mechanism for high-quality model aggregation is proposed. Specifically, the blockchain transforms the federated learning into a decentralized and trustworthy manner. Over the blockchain, federated learning tasks, undertaken by smart contracts, can be conducted transparently and fairly. Besides, a reputation-constrained data contribution and reward allocation mechanism is designed to encourage data owners to participate in BFL and contribute high-quality data. The noncooperative game is adopted to analyze the behavior strategies of data owners. The existence of the unique equilibrium is proved and the equilibrium point indicates that the data owners can acquire highest reward with the contribution of the highest quality data. Thus, the model quality of BFL is guaranteed. Finally, simulations on the public data sets (MNIST and CIFAR10) demonstrate that BFL with a reputation mechanism can well promote the high-quality model aggregation of federated learning as well as can prevent malicious nodes from corrupting the training task.},

  abstract     = {Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is gradually changing the mode of traditional industries with the rapid development of big data. Besides, thanks to the development of deep learning, it can be used to extract useful knowledge from the large amount of data in the IIoT to help improve production and service quality. However, the lack of large-scale data sets will lead to low performance and overfitting of learning models. Therefore, federated deep learning with distributed data sets has been proposed. Nevertheless, the research has shown that federated learning can also leak the private data of participants. In IIoT, once the privacy of participants in some special application scenarios is leaked, it will directly affect national security and people’s lives, such as smart power grid and smart medical care. At present, several privacy-preserving federated learning schemes have been proposed to preserve data privacy of participants, but security issues prevent them from being fully applied. In this article, we analyze the security of the DeepPAR scheme proposed by Zhang et al., and point out that the scheme is insecure in the re-encryption key generation process, which will cause the leakage of the secret key of participants or the proxy server. In addition, the scheme is not resistant to collusion attacks between the parameter server and participants. Based on this, we propose an improved scheme. The security proof shows that the improved scheme solves the security problem of the original scheme and is resistant to collusion attacks. Finally, the security and accuracy of the scheme is illustrated by performance analysis.},

Since a certain number of users may not be able to participate in FL due to interference and energy constraints, a joint energy management and user scheduling problem in FL over wireless systems is formulated. This problem is formulated as an optimization problem whose goal is to minimize the FL training loss via optimizing user scheduling. To find how the transmit power, the number of scheduled users and user association, affect the training loss, the FL convergence rate is first analyzed. Given this analytical result, the original optimization problem can be decomposed, simplified, and solved. Simulation results show that the proposed user scheduling and user association algorithm can reduce training loss compared to a standard FL algorithm.},

However, these platforms are complex to use and require a deep understanding of FL, which imposes high barriers to entry for beginners, limits the productivity of researchers, and compromises deployment efficiency. In this article, we propose the first low-code FL platform, EasyFL, to enable users with various levels of expertise to experiment and prototype FL applications with little coding. We achieve this goal while ensuring great flexibility and extensibility for customization by unifying simple API design, modular design, and granular training flow abstraction. With only a few lines of code (LOC), EasyFL empowers them with many out-of-the-box functionalities to accelerate experimentation and deployment. These practical functionalities are heterogeneity simulation, comprehensive tracking, distributed training optimization, and seamless deployment. They are proposed based on challenges identified in the proposed FL life cycle. Compared with other platforms, EasyFL not only requires just three LOC (at least  $10\times $  lesser) to build a vanilla FL application but also incurs lower training overhead. Besides, our evaluations demonstrate that EasyFL expedites distributed training by  $1.5\times $ . It also improves the efficiency of deployment. We believe that EasyFL will increase the productivity of researchers and democratize FL to wider audiences.},

Although the importance of developing privacy-preserving FL has attracted a lot of attentions, the existing research only focuses on FL with independent identically distributed (i.i.d.) data and lacks study of non-i.i.d. scenario. What is worse, the assumption of i.i.d. data is impractical, reducing the performance of privacy protection in real applications. In this article, we carry out an innovative exploration of privacy protection in FL with non-i.i.d. data. First, a thorough analysis on privacy leakage in FL is conducted with proving the performance upper bound of privacy inference attack. Based on our analysis, a novel algorithm, 2DP-FL, is designed to achieve differential privacy by adding noise during training local models and when distributing global model. Especially, our 2DP-FL algorithm has a flexibility of noise addition to meet various needs and has a convergence upper bound. Finally, the real-data experiments can validate the results of our the oretical analysis and the advantages of 2DP-FL in privacy protection, learning convergence, and model accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML) algorithms are essential components in autonomous driving. In most existing connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), a large amount of driving data collected from multiple vehicles are sent to a central server for unified training. However, data privacy and security have become crucial during the data-sharing process. Federated learning (FL) for data security has arisen nowadays, and it can improve the data privacy of distribute machine learning. However, the malicious attackers can still be able to attack the training process. Due to the complete reliance on the central server, FL is very fragile. To address the above problem, we propose Bift: 1) a fully decentralized ML system combined with FL and 2) blockchain to provide a privacy-preserving ML process for CAVs. Bift enables distributed CAVs to train ML models locally using their own driving data and then to upload the local models to get a better global model. More importantly, Bift provides a consensus algorithm named Proof of Federated Learning to resist possible adversaries. We evaluate the performance of Bift and demonstrate that Bift is scalable and robust, and can defend against malicious attacks.},

In each round of synchronous FL training, only a fraction of available clients are chosen to participate, and the selection decision might have a significant effect on the training efficiency, as well as the final model performance. In this article, we investigate the client selection problem under a volatile context, in which the local training of heterogeneous clients is likely to fail due to various kinds of reasons and in different levels of frequency. Intuitively, too much training failure might potentially reduce the training efficiency, while too much selection on clients with greater stability might introduce bias, thereby resulting in degradation of the training effectiveness. To tackle this tradeoff, we, in this article, formulate the client selection problem under joint consideration of effective participation and fairness. Furthermore, we propose E3CS, a stochastic client selection scheme as a solution. According to our experimental results over a public data set, the proposed selection scheme is able to achieve up to  $2\times $  faster convergence to a fixed model accuracy while maintaining the same level of final model accuracy, compared with the state-of-the-art selection schemes.},

The current widely used global navigation satellite systems (GNSS) cannot meet the precision requirements of the submeter level. Due to the development of sensing techniques and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications, some vehicles can interact with surrounding landmarks to achieve precise positioning. Existing work aims to realize the positioning correction of common vehicles by sharing the positioning data of sensor-rich vehicles. However, the privacy of trajectory data makes it difficult to collect and train data centrally. Moreover, uploading vehicle location data wastes network resources. To fill these gaps, this article proposes a vehicle cooperative positioning (CP) system based on federated learning (FedVCP), which makes full use of the potential of social Internet of Things (IoT) and collaborative edge computing (CEC) to provide high-precision positioning correction while ensuring user privacy. To the best of our knowledge, this article is the first attempt to solve the privacy of CP from a perspective of federated learning. In addition, we take the advantages of local cooperation through vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications in data augmentation. For individual differences in vehicle positioning, we utilize transfer learning to eliminate the impact of such differences. Extensive experiments on real data demonstrate that our proposed model is superior to the baseline method in terms of effectiveness and convergence speed.},

  abstract     = {The dilemma between the ever-increasing demands for data processing, and the limited capabilities of mobile devices in a wireless communication system calls for the appearance of federated learning (FL). As a distributed machine learning (ML) method, FL executes in an iterative manner by distributing the global model parameters and aggregating the local model parameters, which avoids the transmission of huge raw data and preserves data privacy during the training process. However, since FL cannot control the local training and transmission process, this gives malicious users the opportunity to deteriorate the global aggregation. We adopt a reputation model based on beta distribution function to measure the credibility of local users, and propose a reputation-based scheduling policy with user fairness constraint. By taking into account the impact of wireless channel conditions and malicious attack features, we derive tractable expressions for the convergence rate of FL in a wireless setting. Moreover, we validate the superiority of the proposed reputation-based scheduling policy via numerical analysis and empirical simulations. The results show that the proposed secure wireless FL framework can not only distinguish malicious users from normal users but also effectively defend against several typical attack types featured in attack intensity and attack frequency. The analysis also reveals that the effect of average attack intensity on the convergence performance of FL is dominated by the percentage of malicious user equipments (UEs), and imposes even greater negative effect on the convergence performance of FL as the percentage of malicious UEs increases.},

However, the data-hungry and location-specific training process hinders its scalable deployment at large sizes. In this work, we propose WiFederated, a federated learning (FL) approach to train machine learning models for WiFi sensing tasks. Using WiFederated, client devices can not only perform training in parallel at the edge instead of sequentially at a central server but can also collaboratively learn and share generalizable location-independent traits about physical actions being monitored. We demonstrate that an FL model trained on as few as 2–3 locations can provide high prediction accuracy in new locations even without any data available from them. We also demonstrate how new locations can achieve higher prediction accuracy even with a small number of available samples when using the pretrained FL model rather than training from scratch. The results show that the FL model can save local training epochs and reduce the need for large data collection at each new location. Thus, the proposed WiFederated system scales as more locations are added. We show that WiFederated provides a more accurate and time-efficient solution compared to existing transfer learning and adversarial learning solutions thanks to the parallel training ability at multiple clients. By introducing new client selection methods during the FL process, we also show that accuracy can further increase. Finally, we evaluate the feasibility of training models at the edge and introduce continuous annotation to allow for continuous learning over time.},

  abstract     = {Privacy-preserving transportation mode identification (TMI) is among the key challenges toward future intelligent transportation systems. With recent developments in federated learning (FL), crowdsourcing has emerged as a promising cost-effective data source for training powerful TMI classifiers without compromising users’ data privacy. However, existing TMI approaches have relied heavily on the availability of transportation mode labels, which is often limited in real-world applications. While recent semisupervised studies have partially addressed this issue by assigning pseudolabels to unlabeled data, such practice often degrades classification performance as more unlabeled data are incorporated. In response to this issue, we present a semisupervised FL scheme for TMI termed mean teacher semisupervised FL (MTSSFL). MTSSFL trains a deep neural network ensemble under a novel semisupervised FL framework, achieving highly accurate and privacy-protected crowdsourced TMI without depending on the availability of massive labeled data. MTSSFL introduces consistency updating to insert the global model in the gradient updates of the local models that only have unlabeled data to improve their training. We also devise mean-teacher-averaging, a secure parameter aggregation mechanism that further boosts the global model’s TMI performance without requiring additional training. Our extensive case studies on a real-world data set demonstrate that MTSSFL’s classification accuracy is merely 1.1% lower than the state-of-the-art semisupervised TMI approach while being the only one to satisfy FL’s privacy-preserving constraints. In addition, MTSSFL can achieve high accuracy with less training overhead due to the proposed semisupervised learning design.},

Second, we propose a dynamic incentive model based on the evolutionary game theory to model the game process of users in data sharing and analyze the stability of their strategies.

Our work is the first to apply the evolutionary game theory to the study of incentives in federated learning, and plays a leading role in the study of incentives in federated learning.

Of great interest is the design and optimization of new wireless network structures that support the stable and fast operation of FL. Cell-free massive multiple-input–multiple-output (CFmMIMO) turns out to be a suitable candidate, which allows each communication round in the iterative FL process to be stably executed within a large-scale coherence time. Aiming to reduce the total execution time of the FL process in CFmMIMO, this article proposes choosing only a subset of available users to participate in FL. An optimal selection of users with favorable link conditions would minimize the execution time of each communication round while limiting the total number of communication rounds required. Toward this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem of user selection, transmit power, and processing frequency, subject to a predefined minimum number of participating users to guarantee the quality of learning. We then develop a new algorithm that is proven to converge to the neighborhood of the stationary points of the formulated problem. Numerical results confirm that our proposed approach significantly reduces the FL total execution time over baseline schemes. The time reduction is more pronounced when the density of access point deployments is moderately low.},

Different from traditional distributed learning systems, federated learning suffers from data heterogeneity (since the devices sample their data from possibly different distributions), which induces additional variance among devices during training. Various variance-reduced training algorithms have been introduced to combat the effects of data heterogeneity, while they usually cost additional communication resources to deliver necessary control information. Additionally, data privacy remains a critical issue in FL and, thus, there have been attempts at bringing Differential Privacy to this framework as a mediator between utility and privacy requirements. This article investigates the tradeoffs between communication costs and training variance under a resource-constrained federated system theoretically and experimentally, and studies how communication reduction techniques interplay in a differentially private setting. The results provide important insights into designing practical privacy-aware federated learning systems.},

  abstract     = {Estimating the travel time of a path is an essential topic for the intelligent transportation system. It serves as the foundation for real-world applications, such as traffic monitoring, route planning, and taxi dispatching. However, building a model for such a data-driven task requires a large amount of users’ travel information, which closely relates to their privacy and, thus, is less likely to be shared. The not independent and identically distributed (Non-IID) trajectory data across data owners also make a predictive model extremely challenging to be personalized if we directly apply federated learning. Finally, previous work on travel time estimation (TTE) does not consider the real-time traffic state of roads, which we argue, can significantly influence the prediction. To address the above challenges, we introduce GOF-TTE for the mobile user group, generative online federated learning framework for TTE, which 1) utilizes the federated learning approach, allowing private data to be kept on client devices while training, and designs the global model as an online generative model shared by all clients to infer the real-time road traffic state and 2) apart from sharing a base model at the server, adapts a fine-tuned personalized model for every client to study their personal driving habits, making up for the residual error made by localized global model prediction. We also employ a simple privacy attack to our framework and implement the differential privacy mechanism to guarantee privacy safety further. Finally, we conduct experiments on two real-world public taxi data sets of DiDi Chengdu and Xi’an. The experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework.},

The federated average algorithm has been widely used for distributed optimization via training local models in parallel and aggregating local models in a server to obtain the global model. To further improve the performance of the federated average algorithm, a novel federated learning algorithm have been proposed in this article by embedding a lazy strategy in the distributed Adam-type algorithm. In the proposed algorithm, the learning rate is adjusted adaptively in local update and lazy update strategy is applied on the second-order momentum of clients to make the learning rate identical. The convergence of the proposed algorithm is provided for both convex and nonconvex loss functions. Experiments have been conducted on MNIST digit recognition data set and CIFAR-10 data set. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the communication overhead, thereby reduce the training time by 60% for CIFAR-10 data set, and the proposed algorithm achieve better performance than the federated average algorithm and its momentum version.},

UAV mobile edge computing (MEC) architectures have been proposed by integrating UAVs into MEC networks during the current novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) era. UAV mobile edge computing (MEC) shares personal data with external parties (such as edge servers) during intelligent medical analytics. However, this technique raises privacy concerns about patients’ health data. More recently, the concept of federal learning (FL) has been set up to protect mobile user data privacy. Compared to traditional machine learning, federated learning requires a decentralized distribution system to enhance trust for UAVs. Blockchain technology provides a secure and reliable solution for FL settings between multiple untrusted parties with anonymous, immutable, and distributed features. Therefore, blockchain-enabled FL provides both theories and techniques to improve the performance of intelligent UAV edge computing networks from various perspectives.

Second, we will discuss how to integrate blockchain and FL into UAV edge computing networks and the associated challenges and solutions.

A novel privacy-preserving edge intelligent computing framework for image classification in IoT is proposed to address these challenges. Specifically, the autoencoder will be trained unsupervised at each edge device individually, and then the obtained latent vectors transmitted to the edge server for the training of a classifier. This framework would reduce the communication overhead and protect end-users’ data. Compared to federated learning, the training of the classifier in the proposed framework is not subject to the constraints of the edge devices, and the autoencoder can be trained independently at each edge device without any server involvement. Compared to collaborative intelligence such as SplitNN, the proposed method does not suffer from high communication cost as noticed in SplitNN. Furthermore, the privacy of the end-users’ data is protected by transmitting latent vectors and without the additional cost of encryption. Experimental results provide insights on the image classification performance vs. various design parameters such as the data compression ratio of the autoencoder and the model complexity.},

Recently, many artificial intelligence-based approaches have been used for COVID-19 detection, but they often require public data sharing with cloud data centers and thus, remain privacy concerns. This article proposes a new federated learning (FL) scheme, called FedGAN, to generate realistic COVID-19 images for facilitating privacy-enhanced COVID-19 detection with generative adversarial networks (GANs) in edge cloud computing. Particularly, we first propose a GAN where a discriminator and a generator based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) at each edge-based medical institution alternatively are trained to mimic the real COVID-19 data distribution. Then, we propose a new FL solution, which allows local GANs to collaborate and exchange learned parameters with a cloud server, aiming to enrich the global GAN model for generating realistic COVID-19 images without the need for sharing actual data. To enhance the privacy in federated COVID-19 data analytics, we integrate a differential privacy solution at each hospital institution. Moreover, we propose a new blockchain-based FedGAN framework for secure COVID-19 data analytics by decentralizing the FL process with a new mining solution for low running latency. Simulations results demonstrate the superiority of our approach for COVID-19 detection over the state-of-the-art schemes.},

This article combines wireless powered communication (WPC) technology with an MEC network, where a base station (BS) can transfer wireless energy to edge users (EUs) and execute computation-intensive tasks through task offloading. Traditional numerical optimization methods are time-consuming approaches for solving this problem in time-varying wireless channels, and centralized deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is not stable in large-scale dynamic IoT networks. Therefore, we propose a federated DRL-based online task offloading and resource allocation (FDOR) algorithm. In this algorithm, DRL is executed in EUs, and federated learning (FL) uses the distributed architecture of MEC to aggregate and update the parameters. To further solve the problem of the non-IID data of mobile EUs, we devise an adaptive method that automatically adjusts the FDOR algorithm’s learning rate. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FDOR algorithm is superior to the traditional numerical optimization method and the existing DRL algorithm in four aspects: convergence speed, execution delay, overall calculation rate and stability in large-scale and dynamic IoT.},

  abstract     = {Resource allocation is a fundamental research issue in IoT edge computing, and reinforcement learning is fast becoming a common solution. The majority of the current techniques involve decision makers who determine how and where resources should be distributed. In a standard cloud system, this decision maker is a central server. In an edge system, the decision maker is an edge host. Both approaches have drawbacks. Edge hosts do not always have access to enough global information to create the most optimal resource allocation strategy. Central servers do but at the cost of privacy. A solution is needed that can do both. This article, therefore, presents a novel resource allocation method called concurrent federated reinforcement learning. The scheme inherits the privacy protection of federated learning, the complex problem solving power of reinforcement learning and adds concurrency in the form of joint decision making so the resource allocation strategies work to the benefit of the global system. The experiments demonstrate that the approach provides the state-of-the-art performance in system-wide utility, speed of task completion, and resource utilization.},

First, we formulate a kind of age-sensitive MEC models and define the average Age-of-Information (AoI) minimization problems of interests.

To improve the system performance, we develop the corresponding online algorithm by introducing the edge federated learning mode into the multiagent cooperation whose advantages on learning convergence can be guaranteed theoretically. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first joint MEC collaboration algorithm that combines the edge federated mode with the multiagent actor–critic RL. Furthermore, we evaluate the proposed approach and compare it with popular RL-based methods. As a result, the proposed algorithm not only outperforms the baselines on average system age, but also promotes the stability of training process.

However, data island and computing resources limitations in the centralized AI architectures have increased their technical barriers, and thus distributed AI collaboration in data, models, and resources has attracted intensive research interests. Since the existing trust-based collaboration models are no longer applicable for the large-scale distributed collaboration among trustless machines in open and dynamic environments, this article proposes a novel decentralized AI collaboration framework, i.e., learning markets (LM), in which blockchain provides a trustless environment for collaboration and transaction, while smart contracts serve as software-defined agents to encapsulate and process scalable collaboration relationships and market mechanisms. LM can not only help those participants without mutual trust realize collaborative mining with dynamic and quantitative rewards but also build an AI market with natural auditability and traceability for trading trusted and verified models. We implement and comprehensively analyze LM based on the Ethereum interplenary file system platform (IPFS), and the results prove that it has advantages in collaboration fairness, transparency, security, decentralization and universality.

Subsequently, we design an efficient parameter aggregation algorithm for distributed medical institutions to generate a new global model, and the total amount of data transmitted by N nodes is only $2/N$ times that of traditional algorithm. In addition, data security among different medical institutions is enhanced by adding artificial noise to the edge model.

  abstract     = {Edge computing has been widely used in recent years for bringing services closer to end users, resulting in faster response for applications. However, the sensitive information that leaves the data owner is at risk of being disclosed because the service provider is generally honest-but-curious. Federated learning (FL) is a popular method for preserving privacy by transferring the model from the edge node to local devices and training on the local data set. Nonetheless, the training parameter that communicates between local mobile devices and the edge node may contain the original data and be guessed by adversaries. In order to address the privacy threats, we propose the PL-FedIPEC scheme in this article, which is a privacy-preserving and low-latency FL method that transmits parameters encrypted with the improved Paillier, a homomorphic encryption algorithm, to protect the privacy of end devices without transmitting data to the edge node. Our method introduces the improved Paillier encryption, which brings a new hyperparameter and previously computes multiple random intermediate values in the key generation phase so that the time for the encryption phase has a significant reduction. With this new algorithm, the time for model training is decreased, and the sensitive information is in ciphertext format and cannot be analyzed. To evaluate the efficiency of our proposed scheme, we conduct extensive experiments and the results validate and demonstrate that our scheme with the improved Paillier algorithm can achieve the same accuracy as the original Paillier algorithm and the baseline FedAVG algorithm. At the same time, our method can save a massive amount of time when training the learning model with various settings.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning has attracted widespread attention in recent years because it allows massive edge nodes to collaboratively train machine learning models without sharing their private data sets. However, these edge nodes are usually heterogeneous in computational capability and statistically different in data distribution, i.e., non-independent and identically distributed (IID), leading to significant performance degradation. Although status quo asynchronous training methods can solve the heterogeneity issue, they cannot prevent the non-IID problem from reducing the convergence rate. In this article, we propose a novel paradigm that schedules the gradient with partially averaged gradients and applies the global momentum (GSGM) for asynchronous training over non-IID data sets in an edge environment. Our key idea is to apply global momentum and partial average on the biased gradients calculated on edge nodes after scheduling, to make the training process stable. Empirical results demonstrate that GSGM can well adapt to different degrees of non-IID data and bring 20% performance gains in terms of training stability for popular optimization algorithms with enhanced accuracy over Fashion-Mnist and CIFAR-10 data sets.},

  abstract     = {This article integrates nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) and over-the-air federated learning (AirFL) into a unified framework using one simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS). The STAR-RIS plays an important role in adjusting the decoding order of hybrid users for efficient interference mitigation and omnidirectional coverage extension. To capture the impact of nonideal wireless channels on AirFL, a closed-form expression for the optimality gap (also known as the convergence upper bound) between the actual loss and the optimal loss is derived. This analysis reveals that the learning performance is significantly affected by the active and passive beamforming schemes, as well as wireless noise. Furthermore, when the learning rate diminishes as the training proceeds, the optimality gap is explicitly shown to converge with a linear rate. To accelerate convergence while satisfying quality-of-service requirements, a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem is formulated by jointly designing the transmit power at users and the configuration mode of STAR-RIS. Next, a trust-region-based successive convex approximation method and a penalty-based semidefinite relaxation approach are proposed to handle the decoupled nonconvex subproblems iteratively. An alternating optimization algorithm is then developed to find a suboptimal solution for the original MINLP problem. Extensive simulation results show that: 1) the proposed framework can efficiently support NOMA and AirFL users via concurrent uplink communications; 2) our algorithms achieve a faster convergence rate on independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID settings compared to the existing baselines; and 3) both the spectrum efficiency and learning performance are significantly improved with the aid of the well-tuned STAR-RIS.},

These systems generate heterogeneous data in bulk, which become susceptible to cyber-attacks, particularly the stealthy false data injection attacks (FDIAs). The existing centralized FDIA detection algorithms often breach data privacy and fail to perform effectively in highly dynamic and distributed environments, such as IoTES. To resolve the issue, initially, a recurrent deep deterministic policy gradient is utilized to invent an experience-driven FDIA in a complex IoTES. The attacker intends to intelligently exploit the data integrity of smart energy meters with insufficient knowledge of the system. Subsequently, to countermove the stealth and enable independent clients to train a centralized model while keeping each client’s data privacy intact, a deep-federated-learning-based decentralized FDIA detection method using an attentive aggregation is exploited in this article. The proposed approach is capable of parallel computing and can reliably identify the stealthy FDIA on all the nodes simultaneously. Simulation results validate that the proposed scheme outperforms the state-of-the-art methods under a distributed environment with a significantly higher detection accuracy and lower computational complexity while keeping the data privacy intact.},

Due to the concerns of data privacy, it is often impractical to log all the data to a central server for training a satisfactory model. In federated learning, the participating devices can train a shared global model collaboratively while keeping their data locally. However, it is not a trivial task to train the deep neural networks (DNNs) with millions and billions of parameters on resource-constrained mobile devices in a federated manner. We replace each fully connected (FC) layer with two low-rank projection matrices to compact the DNNs model, and establish a global error function to recover the outputs of the compressed DNNs model. Then, we design a communication-efficient federated optimation Algorithm to reduce communication cost further. Considering that the heterogeneous devices may run different models at the same time, we devise three different training patterns to integrate the heterogeneous devices running different models. We conduct extensive experiments on both independently identically distribution (IID) and non-IID data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed framework can significantly reduce the number of parameters and communication cost while maintaining performance.},

Though FL can address users’ concerns about data privacy, its maintenance still depends on efficient incentive mechanisms. For long-term incentivization to participants in data federation under dynamic environments, deep reinforcement learning as a promising technology has been extensively studied. However, the nonstationary problem caused by the heterogeneity of ICPS devices results in a serious effect on the convergence rate of existing single-agent reinforcement learning. In this article, we propose a multiagent learning-based incentive mechanism to capture the stationarity approximation in FL with heterogeneous ICPS. First, we formulate the secure communication and data resource allocation problem as a Stackelberg game in FL with multiple participants. Then, to tackle the heterogeneous problem, we model this multiagent game as a partially observable Markov decision process. In particular, a multiagent federated reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed to learn the allocation policies efficiently by dwindling variances in policy evaluation caused by interaction among multiple devices without the requirement of sharing privacy information. Moreover, the proposed algorithm is proved to attain convergence at an expected rate. Finally, extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms baseline approaches.},

  abstract     = {Communication system design has been traditionally guided by task-agnostic principles, which aim at efficiently transmitting as many correct bits as possible through a given channel. However, in the era of cyber-physical systems, the effectiveness of communications is not dictated simply by the bit rate, but most importantly by the efficient completion of the task in hand, e.g., controlling remotely a robot, automating a production line or collaboratively sensing through a drone swarm. In parallel, it is projected that by 2023, half of the worldwide network connections will be among machines rather than humans. In this context, it is crucial to establish a new paradigm for designing communication strategies for multi-agent cyber-physical systems. This is a daunting task, since it requires a combination of principles from information, communication, control theories and computer science in order to formalize a general framework for task-oriented communication designs. In this direction, this paper reviews and structures the relevant theoretical work across a wide range of scientific communities. Subsequently, it proposes a general conceptual framework for task-oriented communication design, along with its specializations according to targeted use cases. Furthermore, it provides a survey of relevant contributions in dominant applications, such as industrial internet of things, multi-unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) systems, autonomous vehicles, distributed learning systems, smart manufacturing plants, 5G and beyond self-organizing networks, and tactile internet.

However, the current realization of FL adopts single server-multiple client architecture with limited scope for FA, which often results in learning models with poor generalization, i.e., an ability to handle new/unseen data, for real-world applications. Moreover, a hierarchical FL structure with distributed computing platforms demonstrates incoherent model performances at different aggregation levels. Therefore, we need to design a robust learning mechanism than the FL that 1) unleashes a viable infrastructure for FA and 2) trains learning models with better generalization capability. In this work, we adopt the novel democratized learning (Dem-AI) principles and designs to meet these objectives. First, we show the hierarchical learning structure of the proposed edge-assisted Dem-AI mechanism, namely Edge-DemLearn, as a practical framework to empower generalization capability in support of FA. Second, we validate Edge-DemLearn as a flexible model training mechanism to build a distributed control and aggregation methodology in regions by leveraging the distributed computing infrastructure. The distributed edge computing servers construct regional models, minimize the communication loads, and ensure distributed data analytic application’s scalability. To that end, we adhere to a near-optimal two-sided many-to-one matching approach to handle the combinatorial constraints in Edge-DemLearn and solve it for fast knowledge acquisition with optimization of resource allocation and associations between multiple servers and devices. Extensive simulation results on real data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

  abstract     = {Mobile crowdsensing (MCS) is a newly emerged sensing paradigm, where a large group of mobile workers collectively sense and share data for real-time services. However, one major problem that hinders the further development of MCS is the potential leakage of workers’ data privacy. In this article, we integrate federated learning (FL) with MCS and introduce a novel sensing system, called federated MCS (F-MCS). In F-MCS, the workers can optimize the global model while keeping all the sensitive training data locally, thus ensuring their data privacy. Nevertheless, there are still two major issues in F-MCS. The first issue is that in F-MCS services, the workers are heterogeneous in terms of computational capacities and data resources. Hence, qualified workers should be appropriately selected to improve the efficiency of the training process. The second issue is that F-MCS is a cross-device FL system, where the platform will finally get the global model after multiple training rounds. However, most privacy-preserving techniques are designed for cross-silo FL platforms, which cannot be applied to real-world F-MCS scenarios. To tackle the above problems, in this article, we propose a privacy-preserving scheme for F-MCS, namely, FedSky. Mainly, by extending the classic FedAvg algorithm, FedSky selects qualified workers based on the constrained group skyline (CG-skyline) and securely aggregates model updates based on the homomorphic encryption technique. Comprehensive security analysis demonstrates the privacy preservation of FedSky. Extensive experiments are conducted on an image classification task, where the comparison results validate the proposed scheme’s efficiency and effectiveness.},

Random forest (RF) is one of the most widely used ML methods in VFL, which has the advantages of strong predictive performance, availability, and the ability to parallel tasks. However, current research on privacy preserving of vertical federated RF is limited, and none of them can achieve the application level of security, that is, in a system where users are dynamically changing, not only privacy can be preserved, but also data integrity can be verified. Therefore, we propose a verifiable privacy-preserving scheme (VPRF) based on vertical federated RF, in which the users are dynamic change. First, we design homomorphic comparison and voting statistics algorithms based on multikey homomorphic encryption for privacy preservation. Then, we propose a multiclient delegated computing verification algorithm to make up for the disadvantage that the above algorithms cannot verify data integrity. Finally, we used the data sets in UCI ML warehouse to evaluate the proposed scheme. The experiment results indicate that our scheme is more efficient than the existing ones that can achieve the same security level.},

To tackle these problems with less human efforts, automated machine learning becomes popular in finding various neural architectures that fit diverse Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT) scenarios. Recently, to prevent the leakage of private information while enable automated machine intelligence, there is an emerging trend to integrate federated learning and neural architecture search (NAS). Although promising as it may seem, the coupling of difficulties from both tenets makes the algorithm development quite challenging. In particular, how to efficiently search the optimal neural architecture directly from massive nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) data among AIoT devices in a federated manner is a hard nut to crack. In this article, to tackle this challenge, by leveraging the advances in ProxylessNAS, we propose a federated direct neural architecture search (FDNAS) framework that allows for hardware-friendly NAS from non-IID data across devices. To further adapt to both various data distributions and different type of devices with heterogeneous embedded hardware platforms, inspired by meta-learning, a cluster federated direct neural architecture search (CFDNAS) framework is proposed to achieve device-aware NAS, in the sense that each device can learn a tailored deep learning model for its particular data distribution and hardware constraint. Extensive experiments on non-IID data sets have shown the state-of-the-art accuracy–efficiency tradeoffs achieved by the proposed solution in the presence of both data and device heterogeneity.},

Different from the conventional FL schemes, since each local sensor now only has partial data samples with type-specific features, the traditional stochastic gradient descent (SGD)-based training method cannot be directly utilized due to the intertype and intratype data coupling. To address this issue, we first transform the training problem into the primal–dual domain utilizing the corresponding Lagrangian and propose a stochastic primal-descent dual-ascent training method with a two-side residual feedback mechanism. Such a method can be implemented in a scalable way and compensate for the data distortion and loss caused by the practical transmission noise. Furthermore, a decentralized joint scheduling, bandwidth allocation, and dynamic quantization policy is proposed by analyzing the performance at each training iteration and the consumed transmission resources. The proposed method is adaptive to not only the channel state information (CSI) but also the instantaneous gradient importance and dynamic gradient statistics. The closed-form convergence analysis is provided, and the simulation experiments illustrate the superior performance of the proposed scheme.},

This article will design a high-throughput blockchain system for 6G networks to achieve trusted sharing and efficient scheduling of network infrastructure, assist future networks in integrating an open Internet architecture, and realize the combination of openness and distributed control. We adopt a shard blockchain design and incorporate digital twins and federated learning; formulate an optimization model for maximizing the throughput of the blockchain network by getting the optimal number of shards, also analyzing other factors affecting the throughput such as service distribution; propose a security performance analysis model for the blockchain network to describe the measures taken against the Byzantine attacks on the network. Analysis and simulation results show that the transaction throughput of the proposed method can reach more than 30 times larger than that of a nonsharding scheme. They also show that when one-third of the nodes in the system are attacked, the consensus of the system is hardly affected; even if the number of nodes being attacked at the same time reaches half of the total number of nodes, the probability of the occurrence of failed shards is still less than  $10^{-4}$ , and the system still has good survivability.},

  abstract     = {In the healthcare domain, a transformative shift is envisioned towards Healthcare 5.0. It expands the operational boundaries of Healthcare 4.0 and leverages patient-centric digital wellness. Healthcare 5.0 focuses on real-time patient monitoring, ambient control and wellness, and privacy compliance through assisted technologies like artificial intelligence (AI), Internet-of-Things (IoT), big data, and assisted networking channels. However, healthcare operational procedures, verifiability of prediction models, resilience, and lack of ethical and regulatory frameworks are potential hindrances to the realization of Healthcare 5.0. Recently, explainable AI (EXAI) has been a disruptive trend in AI that focuses on the explainability of traditional AI models by leveraging the decision-making of the models and prediction outputs. The explainability factor opens new opportunities to the black-box models and brings confidence in healthcare stakeholders to interpret the machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models. EXAI is focused on improving clinical health practices and brings transparency to the predictive analysis, which is crucial in the healthcare domain. Recent surveys on EXAI in healthcare have not significantly focused on the data analysis and interpretation of models, which lowers its practical deployment opportunities. Owing to the gap, the proposed survey explicitly details the requirements of EXAI in Healthcare 5.0, the operational and data collection process.

To this end, we propose a semi-federated learning (SemiFL) framework to provide a potential solution for the realization of intelligent IoT. By seamlessly integrating the centralized and federated paradigms, our SemiFL framework shows high scalability in terms of the number of IoT devices even in the presence of computing-limited sensors. Furthermore, compared to traditional learning approaches, the proposed SemiFL can make better use of distributed data and computing resources, due to the collaborative model training between the edge server and local devices. Simulation results show the effectiveness of our SemiFL framework for massive IoT networks. The code can be found at https://github.com/niwanli/SemiFL_IoT.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is a machine learning technique that allows for on-site data collection and processing without sacrificing data privacy and transmission. Heterogeneity is a key challenge in federated settings. Recently, cross-technology communication (CTC) has emerged as a solution for Internet of Things (IoT) heterogeneity, enabling direct communication between different wireless devices without the need for hardware modifications or gateway intervention. For example, a sophisticated WiFi device can serve as a central coordinator for other heterogeneous devices, such as LoRa, ZigBee, Bluetooth, and LTE, leading to more efficient and ubiquitous cross-network information exchange. However, heterogeneous wireless technologies present different data transmission rates and computing resources, making it difficult to achieve high accuracy in predictions due to large amounts of multidimensional data, communication delays, transmission latency, limited processing capacity, and data privacy concerns. In this work, we propose an FL framework based on CTC for heterogeneous IoT applications, called FLCTC. To demonstrate the usability of FLCTC, we implemented FLCTC and a specific solution for forest fire prediction. FLCTC was concretely implemented as a federal deep learning based on long and short-term memory and used for forest fire prediction, addressing the challenge of data characterization in heterogeneous IoT networks. FLCTC promises to improve communication efficiency and prediction accuracy. Our platform-based evaluation results show that FLCTC is feasible, with a recall of 96% and an accuracy of 88%, offering valuable insights into the use of FL with CTC for heterogeneous IoT applications.},

In this article, a distributed machine learning approach, federated learning (FL), is proposed to carry out DER forecasting using a network of Internet of Things (IoT) nodes, each of which transmits a model of the consumption and generation patterns without revealing consumer data. We consider a simulation study that includes 1000 DERs and show that our method leads to an accurate prediction of preserving consumer privacy, while still leading to an accurate forecast. We also evaluate grid-specific performance metrics, such as load swings and load curtailment, and show that our FL algorithm leads to satisfactory performance. Simulations are also performed on the Pecan street data set to demonstrate the validity of the proposed approach on real data.},

These devices interact with each other as well as with their surrounding environments to sense, gather and process data of various kinds. Such devices are now part of our everyday’s life and are being actively used in several verticals, such as transportation, healthcare, and smart homes. IoT devices, which usually are resource-constrained, often need to communicate with other devices, such as fog nodes and/or cloud computing servers to accomplish certain tasks that demand large resource requirements. These communications entail unprecedented security vulnerabilities, where malicious parties find in this heterogeneous and multiparty architecture a compelling platform to launch their attacks. In this work, we conduct an in-depth survey on the existing intrusion detection solutions proposed for the IoT ecosystem which includes the IoT devices as well as the communications between the IoT, fog computing, and cloud computing layers. Although some survey articles already exist, the originality of this work stems from the three following points: 1) discuss the security issues of the IoT ecosystem not only from the perspective of IoT devices but also taking into account the communications between the IoT, fog, and cloud computing layers; 2) propose a novel two-level classification scheme that first categorizes the literature based on the approach used to detect attacks and then classify each approach into a set of subtechniques; and 3) propose a comprehensive cybersecurity framework that combines the concepts of explainable artificial intelligence (XAI), federated learning, game theory, and social psychology to offer future IoT systems a strong protection against cyberattacks.},

As a result of their susceptibility to malware, effective methods have become necessary for identifying IoT malware. However, the low generalizability and the nonindependently and identically distributed data (non-IID) still pose a major challenge to achieving this goal. In this work, a new federated malware detection paradigm, termed FED-MAL, is introduced to collaboratively train multiple distributed edge devices to detect malware. In FED-MAL, the malware binaries are transformed into an image format to lessen the impact on non-IID, and then a compact convolutional model, named AM-NET, is proposed to learn the malware patterns as an image recognition task. The compact nature of AM-NET makes it an appropriate choice for deployment on resource-constrained IoT devices. Following, a refined edge-based adversarial training is given in FED-MAL to empower generalizability and resistibility by generating adversarial samples from various participating clients. Experimental evaluation on publicly available malware data sets shows that the FED-MAL is efficacious, reliable, expandable, generalizable, and communication efficient.},

Considering the privacy leakage and limited communication resources, federated learning (FL) has emerged to enable devices to collaboratively train AI models based on their local data without raw data exchanges. Nevertheless, it is still challenging for guaranteeing any FL models to be effective due to the sluggish willingness of IoT devices and the model poisoning attacks in the FL. To address these issues, in this article, we introduce blockchain technology and propose a blockchain-based FL framework for supporting a trustworthy and reliable FL paradigm in IoT. In the proposed framework, we design a committee-based participant selection mechanism that selects the aggregate node and local model updates dynamically to construct the global model. Moreover, considering the tradeoff between the energy consumption and the convergence rate of the FL model, we perform the channel allocation, block size adjustment, and block producer selection jointly. Since the remaining resources, handling transactions, and channel conditions are dynamically varying (i.e., stochastic environment), we formulate the problem as a Markov decision process (MDP) and adopt a deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm to solve it. The simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework and show the superior performance of the DRL-based resource allocation algorithm compared with other baseline methods in terms of energy consumption.},

  abstract     = {In the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), remote sensors and endpoint appliances generate vast amounts of data. Decentralized and collaborative learning builds on these IoT data to enable classification and recognition tasks by inviting multiple data owners. Federated learning (FL), as a popular collaborative learning framework, can significantly improve the performance of models without collecting the original data. To invite data owners to participate in FL, various incentive mechanisms are designed to address this issue by researchers. However, existing solutions still face high costs and low utility due to information asymmetry, where the reputation, computation power, and data quantity of the data owners are not known in advance. Therefore, we propose a Stackelberg game-based multifactor incentive mechanism for FL (SGMFIFL). First, we design the Top- $K$  cost selection algorithm based on reverse auction, which can reduce the cost of selecting data owners. Next, we devise a multifactor reward function based on reputation, accuracy, and reward rate, the data owners with high reputation and high accuracy will be of more reward. In particular, to ensure that SGMFIFL can provide reliable incentives in IoT, we use blockchain to provide a secure and trusted environment. Finally, we construct a two-stage Stackelberg game model for the task publisher and the data owners and derive an optimal Equilibrium solution for both stages of the whole game. Experiments conducted on two well-known data sets, MNIST and CIFAR10, demonstrate the significant performance of the proposed mechanism.},

Although these innovations have evolved independently over time, they are increasingly becoming more intertwined, driving the development of new business models. With more adaptation, embracement, and development, we are witnessing a steady convergence and fusion of these technologies resulting in an unprecedented paradigm shift that is expected to disrupt and reshape the next-generation systems in vertical domains in a way that the capabilities of the technologies are aligned in the best possible way to complement each other. Despite the fact that the convergence of the four technologies can potentially tackle the main shortcomings of the existing systems, its adoption is still in its infancy phase, suffering from several issues, such as the absence of consensus toward any reference models or best practices. This article provides a comprehensive insight into the fusions of these paradigms by discussing a blend of topics addressing all the importation aspects from design to deployment. We will begin this article by providing an in-depth discussion on the main requirements, state-of-the-art reference architectures, applications, and challenges.

  abstract     = {In today’s world, the importance of the Green Internet of Things (GIoT) in the transformed sustainable smart cities cannot be overstated. For a variety of applications, the GIoT may make use of advanced machine learning (ML) methodologies. However, owing to high processing costs and privacy issues, centralized ML-based models are not a feasible option for the large data kept at a single cloud server and created by multiple devices. In such circumstances, edge-based computing may be used to increase the privacy of GIoT networks by bringing them closer to users and decentralizing them without requiring a central authority. Nonetheless, enormous amounts of data are stored in a distribution mechanism, and managing them for application purposes remains a difficulty. Hence, federated learning (FL) is one of the most promising solutions for bringing learning to end devices through edge computing without sharing private data with a central server. Therefore, the paper proposes a federated learning-enabled edge-based GIoT system, which seeks to improve the communication strategy while lowering liability in terms of energy management and data security for data transmission. The proposed model uses FL to produce feature values for data routing, which could aid in sensor training for identifying the best routes to edge servers. Furthermore, combining FL-enabled edge-based techniques simplifies security solutions while also allowing for a more efficient computing system. The experimental results show an improved performance against existing models in terms of network overhead, route interruption, energy consumption, and end-to-end delay, route interruption.},

  abstract     = {Under horizontal federated learning (HFL) in the Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, different user data sets have significant similarities on the feature spaces, the final goal is to build a high-performance global model. However, not all features are great contributors when training the global HFL model, some features even impair the HFL. Besides, the curse of dimension will delay the training time and cause more energy consumption (EC). In this case, it is critical to remove irrelevant features from the local and select the useful overlapping features from a federated global perspective. In addition, the uncertainty of data being labeled and the nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID) client data should also consider. This article introduces an unsupervised federated feature selection approach (named FSHFL) for HFL in IoT networks. First, a feature relevance outlier detection method is applied to the HFL participants to remove the useless features, which combines with the improved one-class support vector machine. Besides, a feature relevance hierarchical clustering (FRHC) algorithm is proposed for HFL overlapping feature selection. Experiment results on four IoT data sets show that the proposed methods can select better-federated feature sets among HFL participants, thus improving the performance of the HFL system. Specifically, the global model accuracy improves up to 1.68% since fewer irrelevant features. Moreover, FSHFL can lower the average training time as high as 6.9%. Finally, when the global model gets the same test accuracy, FSHFL can decrease the average EC of training the model by approximately 2.85% compared to federated average and roughly 68.39% compared to Fed-SGD.},

This study proposes an innovative methodology for resolving these challenges, by augmenting the privacy and efficacy of big data analytics through federated learning in the IoT ecosystem. The proffered approach amalgamates a hierarchical structure, a scalable learning rate, and a rudimentary cryptographic mechanism to foster learning while ensuring robust privacy and security. Additionally, we introduce a novel communication protocol - SEPP-IoT, designed to facilitate efficient, secure, and confidential interactions between IoT devices and a central server. In our pursuit of optimizing communication overhead, we propose an adaptive data compression algorithm, aimed at curbing the volume of data transferred between IoT devices and the central server. To fortify resilience and fault tolerance, our approach incorporates multiple mechanisms such as data replication, error correction codes, and proactive fault detection and recovery. Trust management, a salient feature of our framework, bolsters the security and integrity of federated learning. We recommend a unique technique that gauges the dependability of IoT nodes using four trust parameters. We employ the FedSim simulator to evaluate our method’s effectiveness.

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has become an increasingly popular solution for intrusion detection to avoid data privacy leakage in Internet of Things (IoT) edge devices. Existing FL-based intrusion detection methods, however, suffer from three limitations: 1) model parameters transmitted in each round may be used to recover private data, which leads to security risks; 2) not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) private data seriously adversely affect the training of FL (especially distillation-based FL); and 3) high communication overhead caused by the large model size greatly hinders the actual deployment of the solution. To address these problems, this article develops an intrusion detection method based on a semisupervised FL scheme via knowledge distillation. First, our proposed method leverages unlabeled data via distillation method to enhance the classifier performance. Second, we build a model based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for extracting deep features of the traffic packets, and take this model as both the classifier network and discriminator network. Third, the discriminator is designed to improve the quality of each client’s predicted labels, and to avoid the failure of distillation training caused by a large number of incorrect predictions under private non-IID data. Moreover, the combination of the hard-label strategy and voting mechanism further reduces communication overhead. The experiments on the real-world traffic data set with three non-IID scenarios show that our proposed method can achieve better detection performance as well as lower communication overhead than state-of-the-art methods.},

Industries based on IoT generate extensive data, typically analyzed using various machine learning (ML) models. Federated learning (FL) is an emerging, privacy-preserving ML method where clients train models locally and develop a global model based on the aggregation of local models, without sharing the local data set with a third party. However, FL methods struggle to achieve trustworthiness and incorporate accountable ML principles. Blockchain technologies are being developed across different industries to enhance trust and security. This article proposes a blockchain-enabled, verifiable model for securing FL within IoT systems. Our proposed framework combines a trusted execution platform (TEE) to secure each client’s local model training process, and multisignature-powered global model verification to ensure ML model verifiability. We conducted several experiments with different data sets to assess our proposed framework. The experiments demonstrated the high efficiency and scalability of the proposed framework.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is a novel distributed privacy-preserving learning paradigm, which enables the collaboration among several participants (e.g., Internet of Things (IoT) devices) for the training of machine learning models. However, selecting the participants that would contribute to this collaborative training is highly challenging. Adopting a random selection strategy would entail substantial problems due to the heterogeneity in terms of data quality, and computational and communication resources across the participants. Although several approaches have been proposed in the literature to overcome the problem of random selection, most of these approaches follow a unilateral selection strategy. In fact, they base their selection strategy on only the federated server’s side, while overlooking the interests of the client devices in the process. To overcome this problem, we present in this article FedMint, an intelligent client selection approach for FL on IoT devices using game theory and bootstrapping mechanism. Our solution involves the design of: 1) preference functions for the client IoT devices and federated servers to allow them to rank each other according to several factors, such as accuracy and price; 2) intelligent matching algorithms that take into account the preferences of both parties in their design; and 3) bootstrapping technique that capitalizes on the collaboration of multiple federated servers in order to assign initial accuracy value for the newly connected IoT devices. We compare our approach against the VanillaFL selection process as well as other state-of-the-art approach and showcase the superiority of our proposal.},

  abstract     = {The wide adoption of large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) systems has led to an unprecedented increase in backhaul (BH) traffic congestion, making it critical to optimize traffic management at the network edge. In IoT systems, the BH network is supported by various backhauling technologies that have different characteristics. Also, the characteristics of the BH links can be sometimes time varying and have an unknown state, due to external factors such as having the resources shared with other systems. It is the responsibility of the edge devices to be able to forward IoT traffic through the unknown-state BH network by selecting the suitable BH link for each collected data flow. To the best of our knowledge, this type of BH selection problem is not addressed in the literature. Therefore, there is a crucial need to develop intelligent approaches enabling edge devices to learn how to deal with unknown-state (partially observable) components of the BH network, which is the primary goal of this article. We propose an edge-based BH selection technique for improving traffic delivery by exploiting multiobjective feedback on delivery performance. The proposed approach relies on the advantage-actor–critic deep reinforcement learning (DRL) methods. Moreover, to improve the DRL training performance in large-scale deployments of distributed IoT systems, federated learning (FL) is applied to enable multiple edge devices to collaborate in training a shared BH selection policy. The proposed federated DRL (F-DRL) approach is able to solve the BH selection problem as verified and demonstrated through extensive simulations.},

Meanwhile, cell-free massive multiple-input–multiple-output (cell-free massive MIMO) is a promising technology to enable the IoT networks to support FL. By deploying the access points (APs) closer to the IoT devices, path loss attenuation can be reduced. However, the performance of FL is still constrained by the limited power resources of IoT devices. To address this issue, we design an energy-efficient FL scheme over cell-free IoT networks by formulating an optimization problem to minimize the total energy consumption of the IoT devices participating in the FL process. To solve the intractable problem in hand, by exploiting its unique structure, we decompose it into three subproblems that facilitate the development of the proposed scheme. First, we derive the optimal central processing unit (CPU) operating frequency for IoT devices. Then, we design an optimal power allocation scheme to mitigate the straggler effect. Next, a nonlinear programming method is adopted to obtain a suboptimal solution for the reformulated problem. Finally, a three-stage algorithm is proposed for energy consumption minimization by considering these subproblems. Simulation results demonstrate the close-to-optimal performance of the proposed algorithm for energy savings compared with three baseline algorithms and the capability to support large numbers of IoT device access by mitigating the straggler effect.},

Without affecting the global model’s accuracy, some of the noise is also reduced. The reputation mechanism is used to resist poisoning attacks by malicious nodes. It is demonstrated on different data sets that our scheme has high global model accuracy and can effectively resist 30% model poisoning attacks.},

IoT, which incorporates a range of devices into networks to offer complex and intelligent services, must maintain user privacy and deal with attacks such as spoofing, denial of service (DoS), jamming, and eavesdropping. Attacks change with time, and new ones develop every day. Numerous researchers look into IoT system attack models and evaluate machine, deep, and federated learning-based IoT security approaches. However, existing methods do not produce reliable and encouraging performance. Therefore, this study proposes a novel approach for leveraging federated learning to identify large attacks on IoT devices using the novel CIC_IoT 2023 dataset. The approach uses a federated deep neural network to achieve precise categorization. Before model training, the data was preprocessed using various data preparation techniques to guarantee the creation of a trustworthy dataset for categorization. The suggested approach involves feature normalization, data balancing, and model prediction utilizing federated learning. The experimental findings show that the proposed approach attained an exceptional accuracy of 99.00%, endorsing it for attack detection.},

  abstract     = {Conventional systems are usually constrained to store data in a centralized location. This restriction has either precluded sensitive data from being shared or put its privacy on the line. Alternatively, federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising privacy-preserving paradigm for exchanging model parameters instead of private data of Internet of Things (IoT) devices known as clients. FL trains a global model by communicating local models generated by selected clients throughout many communication rounds until ensuring high learning performance. In these settings, the FL performance highly depends on selecting the best available clients. This process is strongly related to the quality of their models and their training data. Such selection-based schemes have not been explored yet, particularly regarding participating clients having high-quality data yet with limited resources. To address these challenges, we propose in this article FedAUR, a novel approach for an adaptive upgrade of clients resources in FL. We first introduce a method to measure how a locally generated model affects and improves the global model if selected for aggregation without revealing raw data. Next, based on the significance of each client parameters and the resources of their devices, we design a selection scheme that manages and distributes available resources on the server among the appropriate subset of clients. This client selection and resource allocation problem is thus formulated as an optimization problem, where the purpose is to discover and train in each round the maximum number of samples with the highest quality in order to target the desired performance. Moreover, we present a Kubernetes-based prototype that we implemented to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach.},

Such an approach when integrated in future network infrastructures (e.g., 6G) can potentially solve challenging problems such as resource management and behavior prediction. However, edge learning (including distributed deep learning) are known to be susceptible to tampering and manipulation. This survey article provides a holistic review of the extant literature focusing on edge learning-related vulnerabilities and defenses for 6G-enabled Internet of Things (IoT) systems. Existing machine learning approaches for 6G–IoT security and machine learning-associated threats are broadly categorized based on learning modes, namely: centralized, federated, and distributed. Then, we provide an overview of enabling emerging technologies for 6G–IoT intelligence. We also provide a holistic survey of existing research on attacks against machine learning and classify threat models into eight categories, namely: backdoor attacks, adversarial examples, combined attacks, poisoning attacks, Sybil attacks, byzantine attacks, inference attacks, and dropping attacks. In addition, we provide a comprehensive and detailed taxonomy and a comparative summary of the state-of-the-art defense methods against edge learning-related vulnerabilities.

In this article, we propose a novel federated unsupervised learning method for image classification without the use of any ground truth annotations. In IoT scenarios, a big challenge is that decentralized data among multiple clients is normally nonindependent and identically distributed (non-IID), leading to performance degradation. To address this issue, we further propose a dynamic update mechanism that can decide how to update the local model based on weights divergence. Extensive experiments show that our method outperforms all baseline methods by large margins, including +6.67% on CIFAR-10, +5.15% on STL-10, and +8.44% on SVHN in terms of classification accuracy. In particular, we obtain promising results on Mini-ImageNet and COVID-19 data sets and outperform several federated unsupervised learning methods under non-IID settings.},

To address the issue of having all the data in one location, FL, which maintains the ability to learn over decentralized data sets, combines privacy and technology. Until the model converges, the server combines the updated weights obtained from each data set over a number of rounds. The majority of the literature suggested client selection techniques to accelerate convergence and boost accuracy. However, none of the existing proposals have focused on the flexibility to deploy and select clients as needed, wherever and whenever that may be. Due to the extremely dynamic surroundings, some devices are actually not available to serve as clients in FL, which affects the availability of data for learning and the applicability of the existing solution for client selection. In this article, we address the aforementioned limitations by introducing an On-Demand-FL, a client deployment approach for FL, offering more volume and heterogeneity of data in the learning process. We make use of the containerization technology, such as Docker, to build efficient environments using Internet of Things and mobile devices serving as volunteers. Furthermore, Kubernetes is used for orchestration. A multiobjective optimization problem representing the client and model deployment is solved using the genetic algorithm (GA) due to its evolutionary strategy. The performed experiments using the mobile data challenge (MDC) data set and the Localfed framework illustrate the relevance of the proposed approach and the efficiency of the on-the-fly deployment of clients whenever and wherever needed with less discarded rounds and more available data.},

To mitigate this problem, IoT devices can be clustered and the clustered IoT devices transmit the updated parameters to their cluster headers (CHs) instead of BS. However, if the aggregated data distribution in each cluster is non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID), the desired accuracy of the model cannot be achieved. In this paper, we propose an energy and distribution-aware cooperative clustering algorithm (EDA-CCA) where several IoT devices with a sufficient energy level are selected as CHs. By considering the distance to these CHs and BS and the data distribution of IoT devices, other IoT devices are clustered, and then a hierarchical parameter aggregation (i.e., sequential aggregation within each cluster and synchronous aggregation between CHs and FL server) is conducted. Evaluation results demonstrate that EDA-CCA can make the model having the desired accuracy with the lowest energy consumption among the comparison schemes.},

This work focuses on developing metrics for monitoring resiliency of the cyber-power distribution system, while maintaining consumers’ privacy. Here, resiliency refers to the system’s ability to keep providing energy to the critical load even with adverse events. In the developed cyber-power distribution system resiliency (DSR) metric, the IoT trustability score (ITS) considers the effects of IoTs using a neural network with federated learning. ITS and other factors impacting resiliency are integrated into a single metric using fuzzy multiple-criteria decision making (F-MCDM) to compute primary-level node resiliency (PNR). Finally, DSR is computed by aggregating PNR of all primary nodes and attributes of distribution level network topology and vulnerabilities utilizing game-theoretic data envelopment analysis (DEA)-based optimization. The developed metrics will be valuable for: 1) monitoring the DSR considering a holistic cyber-power model; 2) enabling data privacy by not utilizing the raw user data; and 3) enabling better decision making to select the best possible mitigation strategies toward resilient distribution system. The developed ITS, PNR, and DSR metrics have been validated using multiple case studies for the IoTs-integrated IEEE 123 node distribution system with satisfactory results.},

  abstract     = {Model migration can accelerate model convergence during federated learning on the Internet of Things (IoT) devices and reduce training costs by transferring feature extractors from fast to slow devices, which, in turn, enables sustainable computing. However, malicious or lazy devices may migrate the fake models or resist sharing models for their benefit, reducing the desired efficiency and reliability of a federated learning system. To this end, this work presents a blockchain-based model migration approach for resource-constrained IoT systems. The proposed approach aims to achieve secure model migration and speed up model training while minimizing computation cost. We first develop an incentive mechanism considering the economic benefits of fast devices, which breaks the Nash equilibrium established by lazy devices and encourages capable devices to train and share models. Second, we design a clustering-based algorithm for identifying malicious devices and preventing them from defrauding incentives. Third, we use blockchain to ensure trustworthiness in model migration and incentive processes. Blockchain records the interaction between the central server and IoT devices and runs the incentive algorithm without exposing the devices’ private data. Theoretical analysis and experimental results show that the proposed approach can accelerate federated learning rates, reduce model training computation costs to increase sustainability, and resist malicious attacks.},

However, this distributed training paradigm requires clients to perform intensive computation for many iterations, which may exceed the capability of a typical IoT terminal with limited processing power, storage capacity, and energy budget. Heavy communication between the server and clients may also result in intolerant bandwidth requirements and energy consumption for many IoT systems. In this article, we introduce the FedQNN, a computation–communication-efficient FL framework for IoT scenarios. It is the first work that integrates ultralow-bitwidth quantization into the FL environment, allowing clients to perform lightweight fix-point computation efficiently with less power. Furthermore, both upstream and downstream data are significantly compressed for more efficient communication using a combination of sparsification and quantization strategies. We performed extensive experiments on a variety of data sets and models while comparing with other frameworks, and the results demonstrate that the proposed method can save up to 90% of our clients’ computational energy, reduce model sizes by 30+ times, and significantly compress both communication bandwidth and transmitted data size while maintaining reasonable accuracy. The robustness against the non-independent and identically distributed (I.I.D.) condition is also validated.},

However, the traditional FL suffers from model inaccuracy, since it trains local models only using hard labels of data while useful information of incorrect predictions with small probabilities is ignored. Although various solutions try to tackle the bottleneck of the traditional FL, most of them introduce significant communication overhead, making the deployment of large-scale AIoT devices a great challenge. To address the above problem, this article presents a novel distillation-based FL (DFL) method that enables efficient and accurate FL for AIoT applications. By using knowledge distillation (KD), in each round of FL training, our approach uploads both the soft targets and local model gradients to the cloud server for aggregation, where the aggregation results are then dispatched to AIoT devices for the next round of local training. During the DFL local training, in addition to hard labels, the model predictions approximate soft targets, which can improve model accuracy by leveraging the knowledge of soft targets. To further improve our DFL model performance, we design a dynamic adjustment strategy of loss function weights for tuning the ratio of KD and FL, which can maximize the synergy between soft targets and hard labels. Comprehensive experimental results on well-known benchmarks show that our approach can significantly improve the model accuracy of FL without introducing significant communication overhead.},

These IoT devices communicate with each other without human intervention and make life easier in many ways. However, the independence of these devices raises several significant concerns, such as security and privacy preservation due to malicious and compromised nodes within the network. Trust management has been introduced as a less computationally intensive alternative to traditional approaches such as cryptography. The proposed FedTrust approach addresses these challenges by designing a method for identifying malicious and compromised nodes using federated learning. FedTrust trains edge nodes with a provided dataset and forms a global model to predict the abnormal behavior of IoT nodes. The proposed approach utilizes a novel trust dataset consisting of 19 trust parameters from three major components: knowledge, experience, and reputation. To reduce the computational burden, FedTrust employs the concept of communities with dedicated servers to divide the dataset into smaller parts for more efficient training. The proposed approach is extensively evaluated in comparison to existing approaches in terms of accuracy, precision, and other metrics to validate its performance in IoT networks. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of FedTrust by achieving a higher rate of detection and prediction of malicious and compromised nodes.},

As space exploration is transitioning from a mere idea to a tangible reality, the integration of AI-powered IoT will be an essential aspect of space colonies, where self-governing systems will be the norm. These IoT networks will have a broad range of coverage that will extend to the farthest limits with the aid of low orbit satellite integration. However, the widespread adoption of these IoT technologies is highly contingent on ensuring that data is protected from malevolent intrusions. Therefore, in this paper we have proposed a federated learning based distributed approach in an SDN environment to thwart data breach that can plague satellite-IoT framework with respect to space communication. Additionally, as part of the implementation of the framework, we have devised an SDN backbone equipped with a traffic regulator to prevent malicious traffic flows in the network. Our system correctly classifies malicious traffic, blocks flood sources and ensures safe data transmission between IoT devices. The implemented OpenMined-based federated learning method is promising with an accuracy rate of 79.47% in detecting attacks. Our future work will be focused on improving the accuracy of the federating learning-based approach and in conducting differential privacy-based approaches to demonstrate the privacy related advantages of the proposed framework.},

Yet, simple FL frameworks (FLFs) naively assume an honest central server and altruistic client participation. In order to scale this new paradigm beyond small groups of already entrusted entities toward mass adoption, FLFs must be: 1) truly decentralized and 2) incentivized to participants. This systematic literature review is the first to analyze FLFs that holistically apply both, the blockchain technology to decentralize the process and reward mechanisms to incentivize participation. 422 publications were retrieved by querying 12 major scientific databases. After a systematic filtering process, 40 articles remained for an in-depth examination following our five research questions. To ensure the correctness of our findings, we verified the examination results with the respective authors. Although having the potential to direct the future of distributed and secure artificial intelligence, none of the analyzed FLFs is production ready. The approaches vary heavily in terms of use cases, system design, solved issues, and thoroughness. We provide a systematic approach to classify and quantify differences between FLFs, expose limitations of current works and derive future directions for research in this novel domain.},

In spite of fluctuations in instantaneous loss of FL, we prove that the expectation of loss converges even in the presence of packet erasure. To mitigate the impact of packet erasure on FL performance, we suggest a paradigm in which the central node (CN) makes use of memory. In particular, we propose two schemes in which, in the event of packet erasure, the CN retains either the most recent local updates or the most recent global parameters. We investigate the impact of coding rate, SNR, and the CN memory on the convergence of FL. For both short- and long-packet communications, we examine a realistic scenario of a massive IoT under the assumption of error-prone transmissions. Our simulation results demonstrate that even a single memory unit has a considerable effect on the FL’s efficiency in erroneous communication.},

Usually, the training of models is performed on central server, but this approach requires the transfer of data from devices to central server.

To mitigate these issues, we propose an efficient hybrid secure federated learning approach with the blockchain to securely train the model locally on devices and then to store the model and its parameters into the blockchain for traceability and immutability.

In this direction, we claim federated learning (FL) as a promising ML paradigm where participants collaboratively train a global model without outsourcing on-premises data. However, setting up and using FL can be extremely costly and time consuming. To effectively promote the adoption of FL in real-world scenarios, while limiting the overhead and knowledge of the underlying technology, service providers should offer FL as a Service (FLaaS). One of the major concerns while designing an architecture that provides FLaaS is achieving trustworthiness among involved typically unknown participants. This article presents a blockchain-based architecture that achieves trustworthy FLaaS (TruFLaaS). Our solution provides trustworthiness among third-party organizations by leveraging blockchain, smart contracts, and a decentralized oracle network. Specifically, during each FL round, the service provider supplies a sample, without overlapping, of its validation set to validate all partial models submitted by clients. By doing so, poor models, which tend to degrade performance or introduce malicious backdoors, are identified and discarded. Due to the transparency of the blockchain, not changing the validation set would enable participants to forge a malicious partial model that passes the validation phase. We evaluate our approach over two well-known IIoT data sets: the reported experimental results show that TruFLaaS outperforms the state-of-the-art literature solutions in the field.},

  abstract     = {Benefit from the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence and wireless communication technology, diverse Internet of Things (IoT) devices with edge computing ability have widely penetrated every aspect of daily human life. However, the deviations of private datasets and the heterogeneity of local models caused by the difference in device composition and application scenarios have hampering the aggregation of global recognition model in modulation classification task, thus constraining the classification performance of intelligent IoT-edge devices severely. To address this problem, we propose a heterogenous Federated learning framework based on Bidirectional Knowledge Distillation (FedBKD) for IoT system, which integrates knowledge distillation into the local model upload (client-to-cloud) and global model download (cloud-to-client) steps of federated learning. The client-to-cloud distillation is regarded as a process of multi-teacher knowledge distillation and the global network is regarded as a student network that unifies the heterogeneous knowledge from multiple local teacher networks. A public dataset is generated by conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE) and stored in the cloud server for supporting the obtaining of heterogeneous knowledge without sharing the private data of IoT devices. The cloud-to-client distillation is single-teacher-multiple-students process, which distills the knowledge from the single global model back to multiple heterogeneous local networks and partial knowledge distillation is used in this process. We implement our FedBKD method in the modulation classification task and the simulation results have proven the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is a distributed machine learning (ML) technique that allows numerous Internet of Things (IoT) devices to jointly train an ML model using a centralized server for help. Local data never leaves each IoT device in FL, so the local data of IoT devices are protected. In FL, distributed IoT devices usually collect their local data independently, so the data set of each IoT device may naturally form a distinct source domain. In real-world applications, the model trained over multisource domains may have poor generalization performance on unseen target domains. To address this issue, we propose federated adversarial domain generalization (FedADG) to equip FL with domain generalization capability. FedADG employs the federated adversarial learning approach to measure and align the distributions among different source domains via matching each distribution to a reference distribution. The reference distribution is adaptively generated (by accommodating all source domains) to minimize the domain shift distance during alignment. Therefore, the learned feature representation tends to be universal, and, thus, it has good generalization performance over the unseen target domains while protecting local data privacy. Intensive experiments on various data sets demonstrate that FedADG has comparable performance with the state-of-the-art.},

Our work provides a comprehensive evaluation of differential privacy techniques, which are applied during the training of an FL-enabled IDS for industrial IoT. Unlike previous approaches, we deal with nonindependent and identically distributed data over the recent ToN_IoT dataset, and compare the accuracy obtained considering different privacy requirements and aggregation functions, namely FedAvg and the recently proposed Fed+.

By distributing the learning process across IoT gateways, FL can improve learning efficiency, reduce communication overheads, and enhance privacy for cyberattack detection systems. However, one of the biggest challenges for deploying FL in IoT networks is the unavailability of labeled data and dissimilarity of data features for training. In this article, we propose a novel collaborative learning framework that leverages Transfer Learning (TL) to overcome these challenges. Particularly, we develop a novel collaborative learning approach that enables a target network with unlabeled data to effectively and quickly learn “knowledge” from a source network that possesses abundant labeled data. It is important that the state-of-the-art studies require the participated data sets of networks to have the same features, thus limiting the efficiency, flexibility, as well as scalability of intrusion detection systems. However, our proposed framework can address these problems by exchanging the learning knowledge among various deep learning (DL) models, even when their data sets have different features. Extensive experiments on recent real-world cybersecurity data sets show that the proposed framework can improve more than 40% as compared to the state-of-the-art DL-based approaches.},

Machine unlearning, a technique that quickly updates the anomaly detection model without retraining the model from scratch, has recently attracted much research attention. We propose a novel machine unlearning method, called virtual federated learning approach (ViFLa), which groups training data based on estimated unlearning probability and treats each group as a virtual client in the federated learning framework. Since the virtual clients are physically in the same machine, ViFLa only leverages the concept of data/local models isolation in federated learning without incurring any network communication. ViFLa adopts an attention-based aggregation method called enhanced class distribution weighted sum (ECDWS) to tackle the nonindependent and identically distributed (non-iid) data problem caused by the data grouping strategy. It also introduces a new state transition ring mechanism into the statistical query (SQ) learning framework to update the local model of each virtual client quickly. Using real-world IoT traffic data, we showcase the benefit of ViFLa regarding its efficiency and completeness for model updates in the context of IoT traffic anomaly detection.},

However, the surge in the number of devices and centralized management brings severe challenges to IoT, such as single point of failure, poor security, privacy leakage, and low reliability. Due to the decentralization, verifiability, and privacy protection of blockchain federated learning (BFL), some BFL schemes have been proposed to solve these problems, but bring new challenges, such as device privacy leakage and heavy security computing load. In this article, we propose a new decentralized, secure and verifiable consortium BFL privacy protection scheme, named LPBFL, which realizes lightweight computing while ensuring the privacy of the local model and data set of the device. To achieve lightweight privacy protection, LPBFL adopts the Paillier encryption and the newly designed lightweight digital signature and batch verification algorithm. Additionally, considering that devices upload invalid or even toxic local models intentionally or unintentionally, we design a device reputation selection mechanism to make BFL more efficient. Finally, the theoretical analysis proves the security of LPBFL and verifies the unforgeability of the proposed digital signature. Comprehensive comparisons and extensive experiments demonstrate that our LPBFL has significant advantages in multiple aspects.},

In this work, we develop a novel compression scheme for FL, called high-compression federated learning (HCFL), for very large scale IoT networks. HCFL can reduce the data load for FL processes without changing their structure and hyperparameters. In this way, we not only can significantly reduce communication costs, but also make intensive learning processes more adaptable on low-computing resource IoT devices. Furthermore, we investigate a relationship between the number of IoT devices and the convergence level of the FL model and thereby better assess the quality of the FL process. We demonstrate our HCFL scheme in both simulations and mathematical analyses. Our proposed theoretical research can be used as a minimum level of satisfaction, proving that the FL process can achieve good performance when a determined configuration is met. Therefore, we show that HCFL is applicable in any FL-integrated networks with numerous IoT devices.},

Labeling such massive data for classification tasks has proven to be challenging. In addition, data generated by different users bear various personal attributes and edge heterogeneity, rendering it impractical to develop a global model that adapts well to all users. Concerns over data privacy and communication costs also prohibit centralized data accumulation and training. We propose SemiPFL that supports edge users having no label or limited labeled data sets and a sizable amount of unlabeled data that is insufficient to train a well-performing model. In this work, edge users collaborate to train a Hyper-network in the server, generating personalized autoencoders for each user. After receiving updates from edge users, the server produces a set of base models for each user, which the users locally aggregate them using their own labeled data set. We comprehensively evaluate our proposed framework on various public data sets from a wide range of application scenarios, from wearable health to IoT, and demonstrate that SemiPFL outperforms state-of-the-art federated learning frameworks under the same assumptions regarding user performance, network footprint, and computational consumption. We also show that the solution performs well for users without label or having limited labeled data sets and increasing performance for increased labeled data and number of users, signifying the effectiveness of SemiPFL for handling data heterogeneity and limited annotation.

Federated learning enables model training at the edge, leveraging the processing capacity of edge devices while preserving privacy and mitigating data transfer bottlenecks. However, the conventional centralized federated learning architecture suffers from a single point of failure and susceptibility to malicious attacks. In this study, we delve into an alternative approach called decentralized federated learning (DFL) conducted over a wireless mesh network as the communication backbone. We perform a comprehensive network performance analysis using stochastic geometry theory and physical interference models, offering fresh insights into the convergence analysis of DFL. Additionally, we conduct system simulations to assess the proposed decentralized architecture under various network parameters and different aggregator methods such as FedAvg, Krum and Median methods. Our model is trained on the widely recognized EMNIST dataset for benchmarking handwritten digit classification. To minimize the model’s size at the edge and reduce communication overhead, we employ a cutting-edge compression technique based on genetic algorithms. Our simulation results reveal that the compressed decentralized architecture achieves performance comparable to the baseline centralized architecture and traditional DFL in terms of accuracy and average loss for our classification task. Moreover, it significantly reduces the size of shared models over the wireless channel by compressing participants’ local model sizes to nearly half of their original size compared to the baselines, effectively reducing complexity and communication overhead.},

With the advances of decentralized FL, the higher requirements of trust and privacy are put forward. Traditional FL heavily relies on a central coordinating server, which suffers from single points of failure and lacks trust in the correctness of aggregation results. What is more, the intrinsic privacy issues of FL have aroused public attention, such as gradient inversion attack in local gradients. However, the privacy of quantized gradients remains serious and lacks attention, especially the most extremely 1-bit quantization in sign-based FL. In this article, we demonstrate the potential privacy risk in sign-based FL by presenting a new gradient inversion attack, which successfully restores the original data from sign-based quantized gradients. And then we tackle the above two challenges via constructing a self-aggregation privacy-preserving FL atop blockchain, which takes advantage of a variant of ElGamal encryption to protect the privacy of local sign-based quantized gradients, and leverages the smart contract to achieve secure self-aggregation for participants without involving a centralized server. Moreover, we analyze that the proposed protocol achieves privacy and public verifiability. Finally, we evaluate the performance of the proposed protocol with a real deep learning model, and the results show that our protocol is resilient against gradient inversion attack in a decentralized environment without sacrificing learning accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Security has become a critical issue for Industry4.0 due to different emerging cyber-security threats. Recently, many deep learning (DL) approaches have focused on intrusion detection. However, such approaches often require sending data to a central entity. This in turn raises concerns related to privacy, efficiency, and latency. Despite the huge amount of data generated by the Internet of Things (IoT) devices in Industry 4.0, it is difficult to get labeled data, because data labeling is costly and time-consuming. This poses many challenges for several DL approaches, which require labeled data. In order to deal with these issues, new approaches should be adopted. This article proposes a novel federated semisupervised learning scheme that takes advantage of both unlabeled and labeled data in a federated way. First, an autoencoder (AE) is trained on each device (using unlabeled local/private data) to learn the representative and low-dimensional features. Then, a cloud server aggregates these models into a global AE using federated learning (FL). Finally, the cloud server composes a supervised neural network, by adding fully connected layers (FCN) to the global encoder (the first part of the global AE) and trains the resulting model using publicly available labeled data. Extensive case studies on two real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that our model: (a) ensures that no local private data is exchanged; (b) detects attacks with high classification performance, (c) works even when only a few amounts of labeled data are available; and (d) haslow communication overhead.},

However, existing PPFL solutions still suffer from a single point of failure and incur untrusted aggregation results caused by a malicious central server, and even cause a loss of model accuracy in an asynchronous setting. To solve these issues, we propose a privacy-preserving asynchronous federated learning scheme by using blockchain. Specifically, we use blockchain to address single points of failure and untrustworthy aggregation results, implement reliable model aggregation utilizing a practical byzantine fault-tolerant protocol in an asynchronous setting, and leverage differential privacy to improve system robustness. Formal security analysis and convergence analysis demonstrate that the proposed scheme is secure and robust, and extensive experiments demonstrate that our scheme can effectively ensure the accuracy of the system when compared with state-of-the-art schemes.},

  abstract     = {In this paper, we address the challenge of limited resources in Internet of Things (IoT) devices by proposing a solution based on digital twin in distributed edge computing networks. Edge computing is a promising approach that moves computing resources closer to the network’s edge to reduce response times in IoT applications. However, simply offloading tasks from IoT devices to edge computing does not accelerate user control. To enhance task performance and improve user management experience, we introduce optimized task scheduling and virtual object management based on a digital twin concept. Our system incorporates virtualization, synchronization, visualization, and simulation functionalities to provide digital twin capabilities. Additionally, we develop a user-friendly web application with a graphical user interface (GUI) for intuitive management of edge computing services. To support our approach, we implement an edge computing supervisor that generates virtualized objects such as edge gateways, IoT devices, and services. These virtual objects serve as resources for creating tasks. Using our proposed digital twin platform, users can dynamically create new tasks based on demand, easily deploy and execute tasks in specific locations, and dynamically allocate edge network resources according to task requirements. An optimized task scheduling mathematical model is presented to compare task scheduling done with and without optimization. Further, the edge computing and digital twin based optimized task scheduling method is integrated with Federated Learning for collaborative learning and privacy preserved computation of sensors sensitive data. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our system by generating tasks for data collection related to indoor environment for prediction of Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) for thermal comfort index of smart homes occupants using HTTP and IoTivity-based devices in distributed edge computing networks. These tasks are properly delivered and executed on the expected edge gateways, showcasing the successful integration of our digital twin platform with edge computing networks. Further, the optimized task scheduling has improved the overall performance of the proposed system, keeping in view latency and processing time.},

But during the ML model training, it may bring privacy leakage by traditional central methods. To address this issue, federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a distributed learning framework for training a global model without uploading raw data to protect data privacy. Since the communication and computing resources are usually limited in IIoT networks, how to reasonably select device and allocate bandwidth is crucial for the FL model training. Therefore, this article proposes a joint edge device selection and bandwidth allocation scheme for FL to minimize the time-averaged cost under the given long-term energy budget and delay constraints in the IIoT system. To tackle with this long-term optimization problem, we construct a virtual energy deficit queue and leverage the Lyapunov optimization theory to transform it into a list of round-wise drift-plus-cost minimization problems first. Then, we design an iterative algorithm to allocate reasonable bandwidth and select appropriate devices to achieve cost minimization while satisfying the energy consumption constraints. Besides, we develop an optimality analysis of the average cost and energy violation for our proposed scheme. Extensive experiments verify that our proposed scheme can achieve superior performance in cost efficiency over other schemes while guaranteeing FL training performance.},

In this article, we propose a flexible and robust aggregation rule, called auto-weighted geometric median (AutoGM), and analyze the robustness against outliers in the inputs. To obtain the value of AutoGM, we design an algorithm based on the alternating optimization strategy. Using AutoGM as aggregation rule, we propose two robust FL solutions AutoGM_FL and AutoGM_PFL. AutoGM_FL learns a shared global model using the standard FL paradigm, and AutoGM_PFL learns a personalized model for each device. We conduct extensive experiments on the FEMNIST and Bosch IIoT datasets. The experimental results show that our solutions are robust against both model poisoning and data poisoning attacks. In particular, our solutions sustain high performance even when 30% of the nodes perform model or 50% of the nodes perform data poisoning attacks.},

  abstract     = {The Federated Learning (FL) paradigm faces several challenges that limit its application in real-world environments. These challenges include the local models’ architecture heterogeneity and the unavailability of distributed Internet of Things (IoT) nodes due to connectivity problems. These factors posit the question of “how can the available models fill the training gap of the unavailable models?”. This question is referred to as the “Oblique Federated Learning” problem. This problem is encountered in the studied environment that includes distributed IoT nodes responsible for predicting CO2 concentrations. This paper proposes the Correlation-based FL (CorrFL) approach influenced by the representational learning field to address this problem. CorrFL projects the various model weights to a common latent space to address the model heterogeneity. Its loss function minimizes the reconstruction loss when models are absent and maximizes the correlation between the generated models. The latter factor is critical because of the intersection of the feature spaces of the IoT devices. CorrFL is evaluated on a realistic use case, involving the unavailability of one IoT device and heightened activity levels that reflect occupancy. The generated CorrFL models for the unavailable IoT device from the available ones trained on the new environment are compared against models trained on different use cases, referred to as the benchmark model. The evaluation criteria combine the mean absolute error (MAE) of predictions and the impact of the amount of exchanged data on the prediction performance improvement. Through a comprehensive experimental procedure, the CorrFL model outperformed the benchmark model in every criterion.},

Distributed FL (DFL) based on Device-to-Device (D2D) communications can solve the single point of failure and scaling issue of centralized FL, but subject to the communication resource limitation of D2D links. Thus, it is crucial to reduce the data transmission volume of FL models between devices. In this article, we propose a quantization-based DFL (Q-DFL) mechanism in a D2D network and prove its convergence. Q-DFL contains two phases: 1) in phase I, a local model is trained with the stochastic gradient descent (SGD) algorithm on each IIoT device and then exchanges the quantified model parameters between neighboring nodes and 2) in phase II, a quantitative consensus mechanism is designed to ensure the local models converge to the same global model. We also propose an adaptive stopping mechanism and a synchronization protocol to fulfill the phase transition from phase I to phase II. Simulation results reveal that with Q-DFL, a 1-bit quantizer can be employed without affecting the model convergence at the price of slight accuracy reduction, which achieves significant transmission bandwidth saving. Further simulation of Q-DFL for the MobileNet model is fulfilled with different quantization bit levels, which reveals their performance tradeoff among the system information flow consumption, the system time delay, and the system energy cost.},

Through federated learning, decentralized IIoT devices can collaboratively train a machine learning model by merely exchanging model gradients with a parameter server (PS) for multiple global iterations. Differentially private (DP) mechanisms will be incorporated by IIoT devices (also called clients) to prevent the leakage of privacy due to the exposure of gradients because original gradients will be distorted DP noises. Yet, learning with distorted gradients can seriously deteriorate model accuracy, making DPFL unusable in reality. To address this problem, we propose a novel DPFL with sparse responses (DPFL-SR) algorithm, which applies the sparse vector technique to reduce the privacy budget consumption in each global iteration. Specifically, DPFL-SR evaluates the value of each gradient, and only distorts and uploads significant gradients to the PS because significant gradients are more essential for model training. Since insignificant gradients are not disclosed, the reserved privacy budget can be used to return significant gradients for more iterations so that DPFL-SR can achieve higher model accuracy without lowering the privacy protection level. Extensive experiments are conducted with the MNIST and Fashion-MNIST datasets to demonstrate the practicability and superiority of DPFL-SR in IIoT systems.},

Federated learning (FL) provides a feasible way to mine information in such distributed data. It involves training machine learning models over multiple distributed participants without raw data transmission. However, due to the data heterogeneity among participants, the performance of the FL model degrades dramatically. Currently, improved methods mainly reduce data heterogeneity from the perspective of modifying the process of model training, which usually have problems, such as high-resource consumption or the need for auxiliary data. In this article, we enhance FL model from another perspective, focusing on data rather than model training. We reduce data heterogeneity by enhancing the trained local data to improve FL performance. Specifically, we propose an FL method based on data augmentation (abbreviated as FedM-UNE), implementing the classic data augmentation method MixUp in federated scenarios without transferring raw data. Furthermore, in order to adapt this method to regression tasks, we first modify MixUp by bilateral neighborhood expansion (MixUp-BNE), and then propose a federated data augmentation method named FedM-BNE based on it. Compared with the conventional FL method, both FedM-UNE and FedM-BNE increase negligible overhead. To demonstrate the effectiveness, we conduct exhaustive experiments on six data sets employing a variety of loss functions. The results indicate that FedM-UNE and FedM-BNE consistently improve the performance of the FL model. Moreover, our methods are compatible with existing FL enhancements, which yield further improvements in performance.},

The scheme breaks hardware boundaries among various IoT devices in collaboration with the assistance of model inversion inference, which gains a new perspective on the utilization of model confidentiality and requires minimal modifications to the existing collaborative learning process. The framework achieves significant improvement compared with state-of-the-art methods, as we demonstrate through extensive simulations on real-world data sets.},

  abstract     = {With the development of big data and blockchain, an increasing number of scholars have begun to study blockchain for data sharing. By studying data sharing models that are based on blockchain, we find that almost all of them have the following problems: 1) it is difficult to protect the privacy and integrity of users’ data, along with users’ data ownership; 2) the storage burden of blockchain is heavy, and blockchain lacks a mechanism for dealing with data with diverse types and inconsistent formats; and 3) the consensus mechanism has low fairness or low efficiency. Therefore, we propose a data-sharing privacy protection model (DS2PM) that is based on blockchain and a federated learning mechanism for solving these problems. The safety analysis and experimental results show that the DS2PM outperforms the previously established schemes.},

Distributed federated learning with differential privacy ensures data security and privacy and allows collaborative training of CGAN models using multiple distributed data sets.

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) presents a mechanism to allow decentralized training for machine learning (ML) models inherently enabling privacy preservation. The classical FL is implemented as a client-server system, which is known as Centralised Federated Learning (CFL). There are challenges inherent in CFL since all participants need to interact with a central server resulting in a potential communication bottleneck and a single point of failure. In addition, it is difficult to have a central server in some scenarios due to the implementation cost and complexity. This study aims to use Decentralized Federated learning (DFL) without a central server through one-hop neighbours. Such collaboration depends on the dynamics of communication networks, e.g., the topology of the network, the MAC protocol, and both large-scale and small-scale fading on links. In this paper, we employ stochastic geometry to model these dynamics explicitly, allowing us to quantify the performance of the DFL. The core objective is to achieve better classification without sacrificing privacy while accommodating for networking dynamics. In this paper, we are interested in how such topologies impact the performance of ML when deployed in practice. The proposed system is trained on a well-known MINST dataset for benchmarking, which contains labelled data samples of 60K images each with a size  $28\times 28$  pixels, and 1000 random samples of this MNIST dataset are assigned for each participant’ device. The participants’ devices implement a CNN model as a classifier model. To evaluate the performance of the model, a number of participants are randomly selected from the network. Due to randomness in the communication process, these participants interact with the random number of nodes in the neighbourhood to exchange model parameters which are subsequently used to update the participants’ individual models. These participants connected successfully with a varying number of neighbours to exchange parameters and update their global models. The results show that the classification prediction system was able to achieve higher than 95% accuracy using the three different model optimizers in the training settings (i.e., SGD, ADAM, and RMSprop optimizers). Consequently, the DFL over mesh networking shows more flexibility in IoT systems, which reduces the communication cost and increases the convergence speed which can outperform CFL.},

Federated learning (FL) enables efficient model generation from local data storage of the edge devices without revealing the sensitive data to any entities. While this paradigm partly mitigates the privacy issues of users’ sensitive data, the performance of the FL process can be threatened and reach a bottleneck due to the growing cyber threats and privacy violation techniques. To expedite the proliferation of the FL process, the integration of blockchain for FL environments has drawn increasing attention from academia and industry. Blockchain has the potential to prevent security and privacy threats with its decentralization, immutability, consensus, and transparency characteristics. However, if the blockchain mechanism requires costly computational resources, then the resource-constrained FL clients cannot be involved in the training. Considering that, this survey focuses on reviewing the challenges, solutions, and future directions for the successful deployment of blockchain in resource-constrained FL environments. We comprehensively review variant blockchain mechanisms suitable for the FL process and discuss their tradeoffs for a limited resource budget. Furthermore, we extensively analyze the cyber threats that could be observed in a resource-constrained FL environment, and how blockchain can play a key role in blocking those cyberattacks. To this end, we highlight some potential solutions for the coupling of blockchain and FL that can offer high levels of reliability, data privacy, and distributed computing performance.},

Nevertheless, due to the frequent interactions between BS and distributed IoT devices for the aggregating/distributing learning model parameters, the performance of FL is fundamentally restricted by the randomness of channel condition. To address this issue, we utilize the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) to improve the efficiency of learning model aggregation/distribution. In addition, we consider two transmission protocols to enable the model aggregation from IoT devices to BS, i.e., frequency division multiple access (FDMA) and nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA). For both protocols, we formulate the total training latency minimization problem under the available energy constraints of IoT devices, to jointly optimize the phase shifts of IRS, communication resource scheduling, and transmit power and local computing frequencies of IoT devices. Moreover, we further develop the efficient multidimensional resource management algorithms to solve the formulated training latency minimization problems. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed IRS-assisted FL systems can achieve significant latency reduction as compared with other benchmark methods, and the NOMA-based model aggregation method exhibits a lower total training latency than the FDMA-based counterpart.},

FL can protect the data privacy of IoT devices without exposing their raw data. However, the diversity of IoT devices may degrade the overall training process due to the straggler issue. To tackle this problem, we propose a gear-based asynchronous FL (AsyFed) architecture. It adds a gear layer between the clients and the FL server as a mediator to store the model parameters. The key insight is that we group these clients with similar training abilities into the same gear. The clients within the same gear conduct synchronous training. These gears then communicate with the global FL server asynchronously. Besides, we propose a T-step mechanism to reduce the weight from the slow gear when they are communicating with the FL server. The extensive experiment evaluations indicate that AsyFed outperforms FedAvg (baseline synchronous FL scheme) and some state-of-the-art asynchronous FL methods in terms of training accuracy or speed under different data distributions. The only negligible overhead is that we leverage the extra layer (gear layer) to preserve part of the model parameters.},

Meanwhile, the fast-developing Internet of Things (IoT) devices provide continually increasing computation capability. Federated learning (FL) was proposed to leverage communication and computation resources to perform machine learning (ML) tasks on IoT devices. In wireless FL systems, devices train ML models with local data sets, and a base station (BS) aggregates these trained models so that data privacy is guaranteed by the isolation of data sets. However, in the existing works, the same global model is transmitted to devices individually over the wireless channel multiple times, while the updated local models are received only by the BS, which ignores the wireless broadcast channel, incurs large communication overhead, and slows down the overall training process. In this article, we propose the FedBroadcast protocol to efficiently exploit the shared wireless broadcast channel for the two-way model transmission in FL. In the downloading step, we let BS broadcast the global model once for all scheduled devices, and design a dynamic programming-based algorithm to schedule devices optimally. In the uploading step, we also leverage the wireless broadcast channel and select some devices to receive all the updated local models without waiting for model downloading in the next round. Finally, to solve the potential block-cyclic sampling problem brought by device scheduling, we adopt pluralistic averaging modification, which improves the convergence performance under extreme data distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FedBroadcast outperforms the existing wireless FL under different system settings.},

We propose a novel graph signal processing (GSP)-inspired aggregation rule based on graph filtering dubbed “G-Fedfilt.” The proposed aggregator enables a structured flow of information based on the graph’s topology. This behavior allows capturing the interconnection of CIoT devices and training domain-specific models. The embedded graph filter is equipped with a tunable parameter which enables a continuous tradeoff between domain-agnostic and domain-specific FL. In the case of domain-agnostic, it forces G-Fedfilt to act similar to the conventional federated averaging (FedAvg) aggregation rule. The proposed G-Fedfilt also enables an intrinsic smooth clustering based on the graph connectivity without explicitly specified which further boosts the personalization of the models in the framework. In addition, the proposed scheme enjoys a communication-efficient time scheduling to alleviate the system heterogeneity. This is accomplished by adaptively adjusting the amount of training data samples and sparsity of the models’ gradients to reduce communication desynchronization and latency. Simulation results show that the proposed G-Fedfilt achieves up to 3.99% better classification accuracy than the conventional FedAvg when concerning model personalization on the statistically heterogeneous local data sets, while it is capable of yielding up to 2.41% higher accuracy than FedAvg in the case of testing the generalization of the models. Furthermore, the proposed communication optimization scheme can boost the framework’s efficiency by reducing the computation, communication desynchronization, and latency up to 70.21%, 99.65%, and 44.61%, respectively, at the cost of 0.36% accuracy and under the system heterogeneity.},

  abstract     = {The growing interest in new applications involving co-located heterogeneous requirements, such as the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) paradigm, poses unprecedented challenges to the uplink wireless transmissions. Dedicated scheduling has been the fundamental approach used by mobile radio systems for uplink transmissions, where the network assigns contention-free resources to users based on buffer-related information. The usage of contention-based transmissions was discussed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) as an alternative approach for reducing the uplink latency characterizing dedicated scheduling. Nevertheless, the contention-based approach was not considered for standardization in LTE due to limited performance gains. However, 5G NR introduced a different radio frame which could change the performance achievable with a contention-based framework, although this has not yet been evaluated. This paper aims to fill this gap. We present a contention-based design introduced for uplink transmissions in a 5G NR IIoT scenario. We provide an up-to-date analysis via near-product 3GPP-compliant network simulations of the achievable application-level performance with simultaneous Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communications (URLLC) and Federated Learning (FL) traffic, where the contention-based scheme is applied to the FL traffic. The investigation also involves two separate mechanisms for handling retransmissions of lost or collided transmissions. Numerical results show that, under some conditions, the proposed contention-based design provides benefits over dedicated scheduling when considering FL upload/download times, and does not significantly degrade the performance of URLLC.},

In this distributed setting, system and statistical heterogeneity, in the form of highly imbalanced, and nonindependent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d.) data stored on multiple devices, are likely to hinder model training. Existing methods aggregate models disregarding the internal representations being learned, which yet play an essential role to solve the pursued task, especially in the case of deep learning modules. To leverage feature representations in an FL framework, we introduce a method, called FedMargin, which computes client deviations using margins over feature representations learned on distributed data, and applies them to drive federated optimization via an attention mechanism. Local and aggregated margins are jointly exploited, taking into account local representation shift and representation discrepancy with the global model. In addition, we propose three methods to analyse statistical properties of feature representations learned in FL, in order to elucidate the relationship between accuracy, margins, and feature discrepancy of FL models. In experimental analyses, FedMargin demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy and convergence rate across image classification and semantic segmentation benchmarks by enabling maximum margin training of FL models. Moreover, FedMargin reduces the uncertainty of predictions of FL models compared to the baseline. In this work, we also evaluate FL models on dense prediction tasks, such as semantic segmentation, proving the versatility of the proposed approach.},

  abstract     = {With the massive deployment of the Internet of Things (IoT) devices, many data analysis applications emerge for the large amount of data accumulated by IoT. Federated learning (FedL) on IoT devices is an appealing mode to train a precise data analysis model. However, existing FedL schemes either take expensive computation costs (e.g., public-key cryptographic operations) or a large number of interactions among participants. Obviously, these schemes are unsuitable for IoT devices due to the limited computational and communication resources. In this work, we propose a lightweight privacy-preserving FedL scheme for IoT devices. To protect the privacy of individual local data, we add masks to intervening parameters. An effective secret-sharing scheme is adopted to ensure that masks can be eliminated accurately. Considering that FedL involves multiple iterations and mask generation for each iteration costs a large number of interactions among users for privacy guarantee, we also design a secure mask reusing mechanism for large-scale FedL tasks. We prove that our scheme is secure against the honest-but-curious model. In addition, we also expand our scheme to deal with the collusion attack. Extensive experiments on real IoT devices demonstrate the accuracy and efficiency of our work.},

However, they confront difficulties in maintaining data privacy regarding the context of the data offloading during the course of offloading in the different stages. To address this problem, in this article we propose C-fDRL, a framework to provide context-aware federated deep reinforcement learning (fDRL) to maintain the context-aware privacy of the task offloading. We perform this in three stages (CloudAI, EdgeAI, and DeviceAI) of the overall system. C-fDRL checks whether the privacy of high-context-aware data with the task being offloaded is maintained locally at the DeviceAI, and low-context-aware data distributedly at the EdgeAI. When there is an offloading task request or a user needs to offload the data, C-fDRL uses a context-aware data management approach to decouple the context-aware (privacy) data from the tasks. This separates the context-aware data from the task for local computation and allows a new scheduling technique called “context-aware multilevel scheduler.” This places high-context-aware data on local devices and low-context-aware data at the edge device for computation before the actual task execution. We performed experiments to evaluate the data privacy with the offloading tasks and the federated DRL. The results show that the proposed C-fDRL performs better than the existing framework.},

FL enables user devices, such as mobile and Internet of Things (IoT) devices, to collaboratively train an ML model by only sending the model parameters instead of raw data. FL is considered the key enabling approach for privacy-preserving, distributed ML systems. However, FL requires frequent exchange of learned model updates between multiple user devices and the cloud/edge server, which introduces a significant communication overhead and hence imposes a major challenge in FL over wireless networks that are limited in communication resources. Moreover, FL consumes a considerable amount of energy in the process of transmitting learned model updates, which imposes another challenge in FL over wireless networks that usually include unplugged devices with limited battery resources. Besides, there are still other privacy issues in practical implementations of FL over wireless networks. In this survey, we discuss each of the mentioned challenges and their respective state-of-the-art proposed solutions in an in-depth manner. By illustrating the tradeoff between each of the solutions, we discuss the underlying effect of the wireless network on the performance of FL. Finally, by highlighting the gaps between research and practical implementations, we identify future research directions for engineering FL over wireless networks.},

Due to the distributed nature of MEC devices, researchers have uncovered that the FL is vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which aim at injecting a subtask into the FL without corrupting the performance of the main task. The backdoor attack achieves high accuracy on both the main task and the backdoor subtask when injected at FL model convergence. However, the effectiveness of the backdoor is weak when injected in early training stage. In this article, we strengthen the early-injected backdoor attack by using information leakage. We show that FL convergence can be expedited if the client’s data set mimics the distribution and gradients of the whole population. Based on this observation, we propose a two-phase backdoor attack, which includes a preliminary phase for the subsequent backdoor attack. Taking advantage of the preliminary phase, the later injected backdoor achieves better effectiveness, as the backdoor effect is less likely to be diluted by normal model updates. Extensive experiments are conducted on the MNIST data set under various data heterogeneity settings to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed backdoor attack. The results show that the proposed backdoor outperforms existing backdoor attacks in both success rate and longevity, even when defense mechanisms are in place.},

  abstract     = {For a wide range of smart agriculture use cases, the prospects of utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT) are immense. Many IoT devices can be deployed for precision farming, soil management, automated irritation, information gathering, or performing some local processing to provide various services. Due to the computational capacity limitation of IoT devices and their limited power, UAV-aided mobile-edge computing (MEC) is proposed to provide IoT nodes with additional resources by hosting their computation functions and making smart agriculture use cases more operational. On the other hand, from the implementation viewpoint, Network Function Virtualization (NFV) is an emerging approach recently proposed for flexible management of such computation functions in UAVs and MEC-server. However, efficient orchestration of the virtualized functions is a challenge. In this paper, we consider a decentralized UAV-aided MEC system in which the NFV-enabled processing nodes manage the computational tasks. To be more specific, we consider the smart agriculture use cases that need live streaming/analysis, such as surveillance or environmental monitoring. In such a network, we propose a method for orchestrating the NFVs efficiently, while the network energy consumption throughout the network is minimized. This problem becomes even more crucial when considering a strict condition on the instantaneous AoI values. Therefore, the problem is first formulated as a Decentralized Constrained Multi-agent Markov Decision Process (Dec-CMMDP). As the formulated problem is NEXP, in the next step, we exploit some structural features of the considered network and introduce the concept of symmetry to simplify the problem. Then, inspired by Augmented Lagrangian dual optimization, a novel decentralized, federated learning-based solution is proposed to solve the problem. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in minimizing the total network energy consumption, minimizing the average AoI, and satisfying the strict condition of AoI  $ < 100$  msec for supporting real-time applications in our network parameter settings.},

However, its huge amounts of data flows and inflexibility for task extension have triggered the urgent requirement of communication-efficient distributed data transmission frameworks. In this article, inspired by the great superiorities on bandwidth reduction and task adaptation of semantic communications, we propose a federated learning (FL)-based semantic communication (FLSC) framework for multitask distributed image transmission with IoT devices. FL enables the design of independent semantic communication link of each user while further improves the semantic extraction and task performance through global aggregation. Each link in FLSC is composed of a hierarchical vision transformer (HVT)-based extractor and a task-adaptive translator for coarse-to-fine semantic extraction and meaning translation according to specific tasks. In order to extend the FLSC into more realistic conditions, we design a channel state information-based multiple-input–multiple-output transmission module to combat channel fading and noise. Simulation results show that the coarse semantic information can deal with a range of image-level tasks. Moreover, especially in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and channel bandwidth ratio regimes, FLSC evidently outperforms the traditional scheme, e.g., about 10 peak SNR gain in the 3-dB channel condition.},

However, in federated learning, malicious participants might provide malicious models by launching the poisoning attack, which will jeopardize the convergence and accuracy of the global model. To solve this problem, we propose a malicious model detection mechanism based on the isolation forest (iforest), named D2MIF, for the federated learning-empowered AIoT. In D2MIF, an iforest is constructed to compute the malicious score for each model uploaded by the corresponding participant, and then, the models will be filtered if their malicious scores are higher than the threshold, which is dynamically adjusted using reinforcement learning (RL). The validation experiment is conducted on two public data sets Mnist and Fashion_Mnist. The experimental results show that the proposed D2MIF can effectively detect malicious models and significantly improve the global model accuracy in federated learning-empowered AIoT.},

This approach puts the privacy of the participants at risk. In this paper, federated learning (FL) is proposed for privacy-preserving collaborative model training on data distributed across IoT users. To motivate participants, we must incentivize the whole process by rewarding each participant for their contribution to the training process of the federated learning model. The process of collective training takes place over a long duration of time and multiple iterations. However, participants in the training process may have varying levels of willingness to participate (WTP) and may contribute duplicate or poor-quality data. Therefore, in each iteration, participants must be rewarded based on their contribution in that specific iteration. In this paper, a methodology to reward each participant based on their contribution and a model aggregation technique are proposed. The aggregation technique uses Polyak-averaging to aggregate weights of local models, with the weightage assigned to each local model being proportional to its accuracy on the test dataset. Performance evaluation shows that the federated learning model formed using our aggregation approach achieves the performance level of machine learning as we perform more iterations and performs slightly better than the model formed using the FedAvg algorithm. Additionally, our incentivization methodology provides better performance-based rewards compared to other profit-sharing schemes.},

To address this issue, we propose a fine-tuning and head aggregation method in federated learning (FedFTHA). It allows each client to maintain a personalized model head and fine-tune it after each local update to generate a local model containing the personalized head. Specifically, during FedFTHA training, these personalized heads are aggregated to generate a generalized head for the global model. FedFTHA meets the needs of both client-side model personalization and server-side model generalization. In addition, a universal optimization framework is employed to prove its convergence under convex and nonconvex conditions. We verify the personalization ability and generalization performance of FedFTHA under heterogeneous settings with benchmark data sets. The comparative analysis authenticates the significance of our proposal.},

Currently, adaptivity, communication efficiency and model security are the three main challenges faced by FL, and they are rarely considered by existing works simultaneously. Concretely, most existing FL works assume that local models share the same architecture with the global model, which is less adaptive and cannot meet the heterogeneous requirements of SAGI-IoT. Exchanging numerous model parameters not only generates massive communication overhead but also poses the risk of privacy leakage. The security of FL based on homomorphic encryption with a single private key is weak as well. Given this, this article proposes a tensor-empowered communication-efficient and trustworthy heterogeneous FL, where various participants could choose suitable heterogeneous local models according to their actual computing and communication environment, so that clients with different capabilities could do what they are good at. Additionally, tensor train decomposition is leveraged to reduce communication parameters while maintaining model performance. The storage requirements and communication overhead for heterogeneous clients are reduced further. Finally, the homomorphic encryption with double trapdoor property is utilized to provide a robust and trustworthy environment, which can defend against the inference attacks from malicious external attackers, honest-but-curious server and internal participating clients. Extensive experimental results show that the proposed approach is more adaptive and can improve communication efficiency as well as protect model security compared with the state-of-the-art.},

However, models based on multihospital data require collaboration among hospitals to integrate local data, which can result in information leakage and violate patient privacy. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that combines federated learning (FL) with inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) to create an efficient medical decision-making support tool while preserving patient privacy. Our approach uses an IRL algorithm with differential privacy to train a neural network-based agent on local data containing clinician trajectories, which learns a private treatment policy by observing patients’ conditions. Additionally, we integrate FL into the proposed algorithm to learn a global optimal action policy collaboratively among various smart intensive care units, overcoming data limitations at each hospital. We evaluate our approach using real-world medical data and demonstrate that it achieves superior performance in a distributed manner.},

  abstract     = {To reap the benefit of big data generated by the massive number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices while preserving data privacy, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to enable IoT devices to train machine learning models locally. That is, instead of sharing the local data sets, different clients in terms of IoT devices only need to upload their local models to a centralized FL server. Client selection in FL is critical to maximize the number of qualified clients, who can successfully upload their local models to the FL server before the predefined deadline. Normally, client selection is coupled with wireless resource management owing to the fact that different clients need to share the same spectrum to upload their local models. The existing solutions of joint optimizing client selection and resource management are designed based on frequency-division multiple access (FDMA) or time-division multiple access (TDMA), which do not consider the dynamics of the clients and lead to low bandwidth utilization. In this article, we propose the Nonorthogonal-Multiple-Access (NOMA)-based resource allocation for client selection in FL to dynamically and jointly optimize client selection for each global iteration as well as the transmission power of each selected client in each time slot within a global iteration. We design the deep-reinforcement-learn-based client selection in NOMA-based federated learning (DREAM-FL) algorithm to solve the problem. Extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate that DREAM-FL can select more qualified clients and has higher model accuracy than FDMA and TDMA-based solutions.},

In this article, we propose a novel decentralized federated learning (DFL) approach for IIoT devices to achieve model consensus by exchanging model parameters only with their neighbors rather than a central server. We firstly formulate the problem of model consensus in DFL as a fastest mixing Markov chain problem and then optimize the consensus matrix to improve the convergence rate. Meanwhile, a practical medium access control protocol with time slotted channel hopping is taken into account to implement the proposed approach. Furthermore, we also propose an accumulated update compression method to alleviate communication cost. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach improves accuracy and reduces communication cost especially under the nonindependent identically distribution data distribution.},

Pooling medical data into a centralized storage system to train a robust ML model, on the other hand, poses privacy, ownership, and regulatory challenges. Federated learning (FL) overcomes the prior problems with a centralized aggregator server and a shared global model. However, there are two technical challenges: 1) FL members need to be motivated to contribute their time and effort and 2) the centralized FL server may not accurately aggregate the global model. Therefore, combining the blockchain and FL can overcome these issues and provide high-level security and privacy for smart healthcare in a decentralized fashion. This study integrates two emerging technologies, blockchain and FL, for healthcare. We describe how blockchain-based FL plays a fundamental role in improving competent healthcare, where edge nodes manage the blockchain to avoid a single point of failure, while IoMT devices employ FL to use dispersed clinical data fully. We discuss the benefits and limitations of combining both technologies based on a content analysis approach. We emphasize three main research streams based on a systematic analysis of blockchain-empowered: 1) IoMT; 2) electronic health records (EHRs) and electronic medical records (EMRs) management; and 3) digital healthcare systems (internal consortium/secure alerting). In addition, we present a novel conceptual framework of blockchain-enabled FL for the digital healthcare environment.

  abstract     = {Federated learning is gaining popularity as a distributed machine learning method that can be used to deploy AI-dependent Internet of Things applications while protecting client data privacy and security. Due to the differences of clients, a single global model may not perform well on all clients, so the personalized federated learning method, which trains a personalized model for each client that better suits its individual needs, becomes a research hotspot. Most personalized federated learning research, however, focuses on data heterogeneity while ignoring the need for model architecture heterogeneity. Most existing federated learning methods uniformly set the model architecture of all clients participating in federated learning, which is inconvenient for each client’s individual model and local data distribution requirements, and also increases the risk of client model leakage. This article proposes a federated learning method based on co-training and generative adversarial networks (GANs) that allows each client to design its own model to participate in federated learning training independently without sharing any model architecture or parameter information with other clients or a center. In our experiments, the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in mean test accuracy by 42% when the client’s model architecture and data distribution vary significantly.},

Since IoMT devices have limited resources, mobile edge computing (MEC) has been deployed in 5G networks to enable them to offload their tasks to the nearest computational servers for processing. However, when IoMTs are far from network coverage or the computational servers at the terrestrial MEC are overloaded/emergencies occur, these devices cannot access computing services, potentially risking the lives of patients. In this context, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are considered a prominent aerial connectivity solution for healthcare systems. In this article, we propose a multiagent federated reinforcement learning (MAFRL)-based resource allocation framework for a multi-UAV-enabled healthcare system. We formulate the computation offloading and resource allocation problems as a Markov decision process game in federated learning with multiple participants. Then, we propose an MAFRL algorithm to solve the formulated problem, minimize latency and energy consumption, and ensure the quality of service. Finally, extensive simulation results on a real-world heartbeat data set prove that the proposed MAFRL algorithm significantly minimizes the cost, preserves privacy, and improves accuracy compared to the baseline learning algorithms.},

In particular, the aerial computing network infrastructure centered on the Internet of Drones has set off a new revolution in automatic image recognition. This emerging technology relies on sharing ground-truth-labeled data between unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms to train a high-quality automatic image recognition model. However, such an approach will bring data privacy and data availability challenges. To address these issues, we first present a semisupervised federated learning (SSFL) framework for privacy-preserving UAV image recognition. Specifically, we propose a model parameter mixing strategy to improve the naive combination of federated learning and semisupervised learning methods under two realistic scenarios (labels-at-client and labels-at-server), which is referred to as federated mixing (FedMix). Furthermore, there are significant differences in the number, features, and distribution of local data collected by UAVs using different camera modules in different environments, i.e., statistical heterogeneity. To alleviate the statistical heterogeneity problem, we propose an aggregation rule based on the frequency of the client’s participation in training, namely, the FedFreq aggregation rule, which can adjust the weight of the corresponding local model according to its frequency. Numerical results demonstrate that the performance of our proposed method is significantly better than those of the current baseline and is robust to different non-independent and identically distributed(IID) levels of client data.},

  abstract     = {Swarm attestation, as an important branch of Remote Attestation (RA), enables a trusted party (verifier) to verify the security states of multiple devices (provers) in a large network (swarm) simultaneously via a challenge-response mechanism. However, swarm attestation suffers from significant redundancy overhead since all devices in the swarm need to be attested in each attestation round. Besides, it faces challenges such as verifier-impersonation Denial of Service (DoS) attacks, highly dynamic networks, transient & self-relocating malware, and Time-Of-Check-Time-Of-Use (TOCTOU) attacks. In this paper, considering not only the detection accuracy but also the privacy of swarm owners in real Internet of Things (IoT) scenarios, we propose an Automatic Federated Swarm Attestation scheme (FeSA). Under this scheme, we design a federated-learning-based automatic swarm attestation protocol that enables the verifiers to identify the suspicious devices by a neural network model and then attest them. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first scheme to apply a federated learning method to RA, ruling out the redundancy attestation rounds while preserving data privacy. The FeSA redesigns the interaction model of RA by a challenge-query mechanism to reduce the overhead of an individual device to a constant. In order to evaluate our scheme, we first set up a smart office environment with 12 types of smart IoT devices for real-world data collection up to 21 days. Based on the real dataset, we demonstrate that FeSA can indeed identify the compromised IoT devices while reducing redundancy. We further simulate large-scale swarms of up to 1,000,000 devices to validate the efficiency of FeSA in large-scale swarms. Last, the security analysis proves the ability of FeSA to resist various attacks.},

The emergence and gradual maturation of Internet-of-Things (IoT) technologies bring the traditional healthcare an excellent opportunity to evolve into the IoT-enabled healthcare of massive data storage and extraordinary data processing capability. However, in IoT-enabled healthcare, sensitive medical data are subject to both privacy leakage and data tampering caused by unauthorized users. In this article, an attribute-based secure access control mechanism, coined (SACM), is proposed for IoT-Health utilizing the federated deep learning (FDL). Specifically, we manage to discover the relationship between users’ social attributes and their trusts, which is the trustworthiness of users rely on their social influences. By applying graph convolutional networks to the social graph with the susceptible–infected–recovered model-based loss function, users’ influences are obtained and then are transformed to their trusts. For each occupation, users’ trusts allow them to access specific medical data only if their trusts are higher than the corresponding threshold. Then, the FDL is applied to obtain the optimal threshold and relevant access control parameters for the improvement of access control accuracy and the enhancement of privacy preservation. The experimental results show that the proposed SACM achieves accurate access control in IoT-enabled healthcare with high data integrity and low privacy leakage.},

Meanwhile, they can virtualize multiple Sybil nodes to make the local poisoning models aggregated with the greatest possibility during aggregation. They focus on making the joint model misclassify the selected attack class samples during the testing phase, while other nonattack classes kept the main task accuracy similar to the nonpoisoned state. Exhaustive experimental analysis demonstrates that our SCA has a superior performance on multiple aspects than the state-of-the-art.},

The solution integrates DT into CPS to accurately capture the characteristics of industrial IoT devices and assist in the HFL process. A two-stage FL algorithm is used that groups Internet-enabled factory machinery and their DTs into groups in accordance with their organizational structure. A global model is created for the groups from the averaged local models and the DT model in the first stage.

Thus, network slicing (NS) has gained enormous interest due to its ability to improve resource allocation. Due to the exponential growth of IoT data, it is difficult for the infrastructure providers (InPs) to determine the appropriate resource to allocate to mobile virtual network operators (MVNOs). In addition, MVNOs and IoT devices may use self-serving tactics that cause MVNOs to violate service level agreements (SLAs). Therefore, a fundamental problem in NS is capturing the interaction between MVNOs and IoT devices and ensuring efficient use of InP resources. This article proposes a two-tier resource allocation technique for NS involving a monopolistic market between an InP, multiple MVNOs, and IoT devices. First, we model the upper tier problem as a Markov decision problem (MDP) and design a federated deep reinforcement learning-based resource allocation algorithm (FDRL-RA) to explore the optimization solution. At the lower tier, we model a trading market between MVNOs and IoT devices as a two-stage Stackelberg game, where MVNOs set their unit prices and IoT devices set their purchase quantities. We use the backward induction method to analyze the proposed Stackelberg game under a competitive pricing scheme (CPS) and independent pricing scheme (IPS), which ensures high MVNOs’ profit and users’ utility at acceptable levels. Simulation results show that our proposed algorithm converges to the optimal solution and effectively maximizes utility under different pricing schemes while providing a high degree of privacy.},

Federated learning, a privacy-preserving collaborative learning paradigm, has shown considerable potential to leverage the rich distributed data at network edges. Nonetheless, the heterogeneity of IoT devices and their connected network environment impedes federated learning applications in IoT systems. Particularly, the stale gradients updated by slower local learners impact the effectiveness of federated learning. Transmitting weight updates with a large number of users leads to network congestion at the edge of the network and incurs unaffordable communication costs. To overcome these challenges, we propose a transfer knowledge based federated learning framework under a resource-limited distributed system. We formulate a knowledge distillation based federated learning optimization problem with the consideration of dynamic local resource. The proposed approach carries out federated learning with the help of knowledge distillation to avoid occupying the expensive network bandwidth or bringing a heavy burden to the network. Theoretical analysis demonstrates convergence of the learning process. The experimental results on three public datasets illustrate that the proposed framework is capable of substantially improving the efficiency of federated learning and outperforming state-of-the-art schemes.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) training global machine learning models over distributed edge devices has attracted sustained attentions. However, the heterogeneity of client data severely degrades the performance of FL compared with that in centralized training. On the one hand, it slows down or even stalls global updates, leading to inefficient communication. On the other hand, it enlarges the distances between local models, resulting in an aggregated global model with poor performance. Fortunately, these shortcomings can be mitigated by reducing the angle between the directions in which a local model move. Based on this observation, we propose FedCos, which reduces the directional inconsistency of local models by introducing a cosine-similarity penalty. It promotes local model iterations toward an auxiliary global direction. Moreover, our approach is auto-adapted to various non-identically and independently distributed (IID) settings without an elaborate selection of hyperparameters. Experimental results on both vision and language tasks with a variety of models (including CNN, ResNet, LSTM, etc.) show that FedCos outperforms the well-known baselines and can enhance them under a variety of FL scenes, including varying degrees of data heterogeneity, different number of participants, and cross-silo and cross-device settings. Besides, FedCos improves the communication efficiency by 2–5 times. With the help of FedCos, multiple FL methods require significantly fewer communication rounds than before to obtain a comparable model.},

  abstract     = {The management of contemporary communication networks of supply chain (SC) 4.0 is becoming more complex due to the heterogeneity requirements of new devices concerning the integration of the Internet of Things in the legacy industry networks. Hence, it becomes a challenging task to secure networks of SC 4.0 from cyber-attacks and provide a robust and efficient defence framework that can resist sophisticated attacks. Machine learning-based intelligent detection algorithms are often trained at either a centralized or single server, which makes it difficult to train an effective model and also it violates privacy concerns if gathering data from other servers at the edge. Classical machine learning approaches function on the legacy group of data placed on a central or single server, which brands it the least favored choice for supply chain networks, with data privacy issues. To address these problems, this article proposes a federated learning-based efficient detection model named, DFF-SC4N, to proactively identify intrusions from SC 4.0 networks using distributed local data training. DFF-SC4N uses communication rounds in a federated learning manner having gated recurrent units by only sharing the learned parameters and keeps the data intact on local servers. The accuracy of the global model is optimized by an aggregating model, which updates from multiple servers and multiple SC 4.0 networks. Extensive experiments on real industrial network data demonstrate that the DFF-SC4N outperforms both centralized training models and state-of-the-art peer methods in protecting SC 4.0 networks.},

  abstract     = {Most speech recognition systems utilize cloud computing for model training and updates. Speech data, being personally identifiable information (PII), encompasses personal, privacy-sensitive, and regulated content. Relying on centralized servers or third parties can threaten confidential data, resulting in privacy breaches. Therefore, privacy issues and strict regulations (e.g., EU’s general data protection regulation, California’s CCPA, and the Privacy Act in Australia) limit the availability of large data sets. The scarcity of data sets is particularly pronounced in less-represented languages, like Persian, adversely impacting innovation and data-driven product development. To overcome the challenges posed by the scarcity of data sets and privacy concerns, for the first time, we propose a novel federated learning (FL) solution for Persian Spoken Isolated Digit Recognition. This proposed technique bridges the gap between privacy and utility by enabling the training of an algorithm using decentralized data sets stored on edge devices or servers, without the need for data exchange. Nonindependent and identically distributed data (non-IID), such as unique speaker accents, poses a challenge in speech recognition, especially in an FL setup. Regrettably, this challenge has largely been overlooked in existing techniques and methodologies. To address this, we present an innovative personalized clustered FL (PCFL) approach that successfully exploits similarities among the private data distributions and captures distinctive characteristics inherent in each client’s data in order to train models. The experimental results show that while the proposed solution significantly addresses privacy concerns, it has a negligible performance loss compared to centralized model training techniques.},

However, collecting all necessary data to train accurate models is often unfeasible due to privacy laws. Federated Learning (FL) evolved as a collaborative machine learning approach for training models without sharing private data. Unfortunately, several in-design vulnerabilities have been exposed, allowing attackers to infer private data of participants and negatively impacting the performance of the federated model. In light of these challenges and to encourage the development of FL solutions, this paper provides a comprehensive analysis of secure FL proposals that both protect user privacy and enhance the performance of the model. We performed a systematic review using predefined criteria to screen and extract data from multiple electronic databases, resulting in a final set of studies for analysis. Through the systematic review methodology, the paper groups the security vulnerabilities of FL into model performance and data privacy attacks. It also presents an analysis and comparison of potential mitigation strategies against these attacks. Additionally, the paper conducts a security analysis of state-of-the-art FL applications and proposals based on the vulnerabilities addressed. Finally, the paper outlines the main applications of secure FL and lists future research challenges. The survey highlights the crucial role of security strategies in ensuring the protection of user privacy and model performance in the context of future FL applications.},

However, FL suffers from non-independent and identically distributed (non-iid) data, which means it is heterogeneous data and has biased input data, such as in smartphone data sources. This bias causes low convergence for ML algorithms and high energy and bandwidth consumption. This work proposes a method that mitigates non-iid data through a FedAvg-BE algorithm that provides Federated Learning with the border entropy evaluation to select quality data from each device by cross-device in a non-iid data environment. Extensive experiments were performed using publicly available datasets to train deep neural networks. The experiment result evaluation demonstrates that execution time saves up to 22% for the MNIST dataset and 26% for the CIFAR-10 dataset, with the proposed model in Federated Learning settings. The results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model to mitigate non-iid data impact.},

To overcome these challenges and enhance worker safety management, decentralized model training-assisted edge intelligence emerges as a promising solution. However, despite the potential benefits, our investigation reveals that no research for worker safety prediction has been grounded in the Federated Learning (FL) approach. In this context, we present a novel approach to worker safety prediction, leveraging FL in outdoor construction environments while preserving the privacy and security of sensitive data. Our methodology involves deploying sensor-based IoT devices at construction sites to collect highly granular spatial and temporal weather, building, and worker data. This data is then collaboratively utilized for training Deep Neural Network (DNN) models on the edge nodes in a cross-silos manner. To implement our approach, we establish a test-bed utilizing the EdgeX framework and constrained devices such as Raspberry Pi 4Bs, acting as edge nodes. Following the collaborative training, the resultant global model is deployed on participating nodes for edge inference, ensuring optimal network resource utilization and data privacy. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach in improving the utilization of construction safety management systems and reducing the risk of accidents and fatalities in the future. The outcome is a system that exhibits enhanced speed and responsiveness, a crucial aspect for time-sensitive applications such as the prediction of worker safety.},

In this article, a three-layer FL architecture is proposed. The FL training process is optimized by jointly optimizing the UT selection, the UAV selection, the data set selection, and the wait delay selection of one-time training. The convergence gap optimization problem is built by analyzing model training convergence, and the node selection algorithm is designed. Finally, the extensive simulation experiments are conducted to verify the feasibility and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for FL.},

  abstract     = {Aiming at protecting device data privacy, Federated Learning (FL) is a framework of distributed machine learning in which devices’ local model parameters are exchanged with a centralized server without revealing the actual data. Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) framework was introduced to improve FL communication efficiency where devices are clustered and seek model consensus with the support of edge servers (e.g., base stations). Devices in a cluster submit their local model updates to their assigned local edge server for aggregation at each iteration. The edge servers transmit the aggregated models to a centralized server and establish a global consensus. However, similar to FL, adversaries may threaten the security and privacy of HFL. The client devices within a cluster may deliberately provide unreliable local model updates through poisoning attacks or poor-quality model updates due to inconsistent communication channels, increased device mobility, or inadequate device resources. To address the above challenges, this paper investigates the client selection problem in the HFL framework to eliminate the impact of unreliable clients while maximizing the global model accuracy of HFL. Each FL edge server is equipped with a Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based reputation model to optimally measure the reliability and trustworthiness of FL workers within its cluster. A Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) is utilized to enhance the accuracy and stability of the HFL global model, given the workers’ dynamic behaviors in the HFL environment. The experimental results indicate that our proposed MADDPG improves the accuracy and stability of HFL compared with the conventional reputation model and single-agent DDPG-based reputation model.},

Building an IDS that detects threats efficiently with maximum accuracy and detection is a challenging undertaking. Machine Learning (ML) mechanisms have been successfully adopted in IDSs to detect a variety of network intruders. Split learning is considered one of the main developments in creating efficient ML approaches. In utilizing the Split Learning approach, an IDS is successful in performing at higher accuracy, and detection rate as well as a higher classification performance (Precision, Recall).

With the highest accuracy and detection rates, the proposed model ( $SplitLearn$ ) outperforms  $FedLearn$  and  $TransLearn$  by 2 to 5 % respectively.

The proposal efficiently optimized the computation frequency allocation and reduced energy consumption in IoT devices by solving the bandwidth optimization problem in closed form. The remaining computational frequency allocation, transmission power allocation, and loss could be resolved with an Alternative Direction Algorithm (ADA) to reduce energy consumption and complexity at every iteration of FL time from IoT devices to edge intelligence nodes. The simulation results indicated that the proposed ADA can adapt the central processing unit frequency and power transmission control to reduce energy consumption at the cost of a small growth of FL time.},

  abstract     = {Among 6G high-density connection applications, the cognitive Internet of Things (IoT) is considered to be an effective means to cope with the problem of spectrum resource shortage and reduce energy consumption. The modulation classification with the functions of primary user detection and signal recognition has become the core technology in the cognitive IoT. However, the remarkable surge in the generated data makes it intractable to store and analyze such a large amount of data in a centralized manner. Meanwhile, due to the heterogeneity of IoT devices, the collected data in distributed devices may be non-independent-identical distribution, resulting in heterogeneous local datasets problem. Therefore, we introduce the federated learning (FL) and propose federated incremental learning (FIL) method to address the problem of heterogeneous local datasets in modulation classification. Specifically, we regard the private classes of a particular local device as incremental classes and incremental learning is adopted to learn the classification knowledge of private classes. In order to avoid excessive dispersion between the global model parameters and local model parameters, we utilize knowledge distillation in the local model training stage for imposing similar constrain of parameters on different local models. Simulation results have proven the effectiveness of our proposed method.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) provides a new paradigm for protecting data privacy by enabling model training at devices and model aggregation at servers. However, data information may be leaked to honest-but-curious aggregation servers by updated model parameters. The existing secure methods do not fully exploit the potentiality of data characteristics in enhancing security, which makes it impossible to optimize limited system resources overall to achieve secure, fair, and efficient FL systems. In this article, a DRL-based joint secure aggregation and resource orchestration scheme is proposed to guarantee security and fairness, and improve efficiency for hierarchical FL (HFL) assisted by untrusted mobile-edge computing (MEC) servers. We formulate a joint optimization problem of data size, payment, and resource orchestration, to maximize the long-term social welfare subject to secure aggregation and limited resources. Since the formulated problem is a complex mixed integer dynamic optimization problem with NP-hardness, where multiple mixed integer optimization variables are highly coupled in time-varying constraints and objective function, it is difficult to obtain its optimal solution via traditional optimization methods. Thus, we propose a hierarchical reward function-based DRL algorithm (MATD3) to guide the agents to approach the optimal policy of secure aggregation and resource orchestration. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm MATD3 can achieve superior performance over comparison algorithms and the MEC-enabled HFL framework outperforms two-layer FL frameworks.},

Recently, the cross-silo FL in multiaccess edge computing (MEC) is used in increasing industrial applications. Most existing research on cross-silo FL pays attention to the performance aspect, ignoring the incentive mechanism for high-quality client selection and long participation in model training for efficient and stable FL, which has prevented the widespread adoption of cross-silo FL in MEC. In this article, we propose an incentive mechanism with quality-Aware and reputation-Aware based on the infinitely repeated game for cross-silo FL named VARF. VARF selects high-quality and high-reputation edge nodes (ENs) as candidates for model training in the cross-silo FL by a heuristic algorithm and then motivates the selected ENs to actively contribute their resources. VARF also models the long-term behavior of ENs in cross-silo FL as an infinitely repeated game and derives a stable and long-term cooperative strategy for clients while maximizing the amount of local data for model learning in cross-silo FL. Extensive simulations with real-world data sets demonstrate that the performance of VARF is more beneficial than other benchmarks. Meanwhile, experimental results show that cloud platforms (CPs) and ENs eventually form a long and stable cooperative relationship under the trigger strategy.},

The massive data collected during the voyage is usually disposed of with the assistance of cloud or edge computing, which imposes serious cyber security threats. For multifarious cyber-attacks, Intrusion Detection System (IDS) is one of the efficient mechanisms to prevent IoT devices from network intrusion. However, most of the methods based on deep learning train their models in a centralized manner, which needs uploading all data to the central server for training, increasing the risk of privacy disclosure. In this paper, we consider the characteristics of IoT-based MTS and propose a CNN-MLP based model for intrusion detection which is trained through Federated Learning, named FedBatch. Federated Learning keeps the model training local and only updates the global model through the exchange of model parameters, preserving the privacy of local data on vessels. First, the characteristics of the communication between different vessels are discussed to model the federated learning process during the voyage. Then, the lightweight local model constructed by Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and Multi-Layer Perception (MLP) is designed to save on computing and storage overhead. Moreover, to mitigate the straggler problem during the federated learning in MTS, we proposed an adaptive aggregation method, named Batch Federated Aggregation, which suppresses the oscillations of model parameters during federated learning. Finally, the simulation results on the NSL-KDD dataset demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of FedBatch.},

Industrial Big Data in key applications such as healthcare, smart manufacturing, autonomous driving, and robotics is inherently multisource and heterogeneous. Recent studies have shown that the quality of the global FL model deteriorates in the presence of such non-IID data. To address this, we present a novel clustered FL framework called federated learning via Agglomerative Client Clustering (FLACC). FLACC greedily agglomerates clients or groups of clients based on their gradient updates while learning the global FL model. Once the clustering is complete, each cluster is separated into its own federation, allowing clients with similar underlying distributions to train together. In contrast with existing methods, FLACC does not require the number of clusters to be specified a priori, can handle client fractions, and is robust to hyperparameter tuning. We demonstrate the efficacy of this framework through extensive experiments on three benchmark FL datasets and an FL case study simulated using industrial mixed fault classification data. Qualitative clustering results show that FLACC accurately identifies clusters in the presence of various statistical heterogeneities in the client data. Quantitative results show that FLACC outperforms vanilla FL and state-of-the-art personalized and clustered FL methods, even when the underlying clustering structure is not apparent.},

We propose an HFL-DDQN algorithm, which combines horizontal federated learning (HFL) with double deep  $Q$ -network (DDQN). First, UAVs are separated into two clusters according to the services they provide, i.e., edge computing or relay communication. Next, the optimization problems are formulated for two types of services, respectively. For the computation offloading tasks of EVUs, the optimization objective is to minimize the weighted sum of delay and energy consumption. For the sensor data transmission of GSNs, the optimization objective is to maximize the minimum rate of relay links. We define the total cost of the system as the sum of two types of services. Then, federated aggregation is used to joint training the global neural networks model without sharing raw data. Furthermore, the DDQN is improved by adopting prioritized experience replay to achieve better convergence. The simulation results show that the proposed HFL-DDQN algorithm not only outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in terms of the system cost but also promotes the generalization in execution process, which is especially applicable to the rescue scene under accidents.},

Owing to the communication and computation bottleneck at the centralized aggregator and inaccurate learning model caused by the non-independent and identically distributed (IID) data, we here consider a two-tier FL network, in which Internet of Things (IoT) nodes are the core clients that hold data, the model aggregators at the middle tier are the low altitude aerial platforms (UAVs), and the model aggregator at the top-most layer is the high-altitude aerial platform (UAV with relatively high altitude). Under the assumption that each IoT node has parallel computing ability, we study the energy-efficient computation and communication resource allocation in such a network within some time budget. Upon formulating the problem as an optimization problem, we solve the computation and communication resource allocation problems as the separate subproblems within a time frame, and then propose an iterative algorithm to solve the entire problem jointly. More specifically, we solve both the energy-efficient computation and communication resource allocation subproblems using the dual decomposition technique, and then apply a bisection search-based recursive technique to solve the entire energy efficiency problem jointly. Moreover, we propose offline and online client scheduling schemes that not only select the optimal edge nodes for association but also assign workload to each client based on the data quality and workload constraint. With real data, extensive simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed resource allocation scheme. The results further reveal that the learning performance not only is dependent on the computation and communication energy consumption of the FL process but also the model divergence weight owing to the non-IID data at client IoT nodes.},

  abstract     = {This article presents communication-efficient approaches to federated learning (FL) for resource-constrained devices with access to streaming data. In particular, we first propose a partial-sharing-based framework for online federated learning (PSO-Fed), wherein clients update local models from a stream of data and exchange tiny fractions of the model with the server, reducing the communication overhead. In contrast to classical FL approaches, the proposed strategy provides clients who are not part of a global iteration with the freedom to update local models whenever new data arrives. Furthermore, by devising a client-side innovation check, we also propose an event-triggered PSO-Fed (ETPSO-Fed) that further reduces the computational burden of clients while enhancing communication efficiency. We implement the above-mentioned frameworks in the context of kernel regression, where clients perform local learning employing random Fourier features (RFFs)-based kernel least mean squares. In addition, we examine the mean and mean-square convergence of the proposed PSO-Fed. Finally, we conduct experiments to determine the efficacy of the proposed frameworks. Our results show that PSO-Fed and ETPSO-Fed can compete with Online-Fed while requiring significantly less communication overhead. Simulations demonstrate an 80% reduction in PSO-Fed and an 84.5% reduction in ETPSO-Fed communication overhead compared to Online-Fed. Notably, the proposed PSO-Fed strategies show good resilience against model-poisoning attacks without involving additional mechanisms.},

However, the principal–agent architecture commonly used in federated learning not only increases the cost but also fails to take into account the privacy protection and trustworthiness of flexible on-demand data sharing. To tackle the above challenges, we propose a secure and trusted federated data sharing (STFS) based on blockchain. Initially, we construct an autonomous and reliable federated extreme gradient boosting learning algorithm to crack the data isolation problem, providing privacy protection and verifiability. Furthermore, we design a secure and trusted data sharing and trading mechanism to ensure secure on-demand controlled data sharing and fair trading. Finally, the security of STFS is proved based on the universal composable theory. The results of ample experimental simulations demonstrate the good effectiveness and performance of STFS for IIoT applications.},

  abstract     = {Remote monitoring systems analyze the environment dynamics in different smart industrial applications, such as occupational health and safety, and environmental monitoring. Specifically, in Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) systems, the huge number of devices and the expected performance put pressure on resources, such as computational, network, and device energy. Distributed training of machine and deep learning (ML/DL) models for intelligent industrial IoT applications is very challenging for resource limited devices over heterogeneous wireless networks (HetNets). Hierarchical federated learning (HFL) performs training at multiple layers offloading the tasks to nearby multiaccess edge computing (MEC) units. In this article, we propose a novel energy-efficient HFL framework enabled by wireless energy transfer (WET) and designed for heterogeneous networks with massive multiple-input–multiple-output (MIMO) wireless backhaul. Our energy-efficiency approach is formulated as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, where we optimize the HFL device association and manage the wireless transmitted energy. However due to its high complexity, we design a heuristic resource management algorithm, namely, H2RMA, that respects energy, channel quality, and accuracy constraints, while presenting a low-computational complexity. We also improve the energy consumption of the network using an efficient device scheduling scheme. Finally, we investigate device mobility and its impact on the HFL performance. Our extensive experiments confirm the high performance of the proposed resource management approach in HFL over HetNets, in terms of training loss and grid energy costs.},

FL has seen successful deployment in production environments, and it has been adopted in services, such as virtual keyboards, auto-completion, item recommendation, and several IoT applications. However, FL comes with the challenge of performing training over largely heterogeneous data sets, devices, and networks that are out of the control of the centralized FL server. Motivated by this inherent challenge, we aim to empirically characterize the impact of device and behavioral heterogeneity on the trained model. We conduct an extensive empirical study spanning nearly 1.5K unique configurations on five popular FL benchmarks. Our analysis shows that these sources of heterogeneity have a major impact on both model quality and fairness, causing up to  $4.6\times $  and  $2.2\times $  degradation in the quality and fairness, respectively, thus shedding light on the importance of considering heterogeneity in FL system design.},

By deploying the IRS on drones, it becomes possible to improve the coverage and reliability of the communication network while reducing energy consumption and costs. Furthermore, integrating IRS with Federated Learning (FL) can further boost the performance of the drone network by enabling collaborative learning among multiple drones, leading to better and more efficient decision-making and holding great promise for enabling 6G communication networks. Therefore, we present a novel framework for FL meets IRS in drones for enabling 6G. In this framework, multiple IRS-equipped drone swarm are deployed to form a distributed wireless network, where FL techniques are used to collaborate with the learning process and optimize the reflection coefficients of each drone-IRS. This allows drone swarm to adapt to changing communication environments and improve the coverage and quality of wireless communication services. Integrating FL and IRS into drones offers several advantages over traditional wireless communication networks, including rapid deployment in emergencies or disasters, improved coverage and quality of communication services, and increased accessibility to remote areas. Finally, we highlight the challenges and opportunities of integrating FL and IRS into drones for researchers interested in drone networks.

One of such promising applications that can benefit from 6G is Decentralised Federated Learning, a privacy-preserving machine learning paradigm. Also, it relies heavily on peer-to-peer mobile connection among edge and mobile devices, instead of a powerful central server on the cloud. However, the data and device heterogeneity, and highly dynamic environment in mobile networks pose challenges to the performance of federated learning. In this paper, we propose a data redistribution phase that balances the data distribution on different participating devices to a certain degree, which can further increase the system performance in the training phase. To derive our method, we first model this problem as a bargaining game, the equilibrium of which is formalised as an optimisation problem. Then we propose two algorithms to solve it: a centralised one, and a decentralised one that each participant executes without centralised coordination. We further improve the energy efficiency of the decentralised algorithm by introducing several heuristics. We evaluate the proposed system with both simulation and DNN training tasks on large scale FEMNIST-based datasets.},

  abstract     = {As a promising framework for distributed machine learning (ML), wireless federated learning (FL) faces the threat of eavesdropping attacks when a trained ML model is sent over a radio channel. To address this threat, we propose channel-sharing-based artificial jamming to increase the secrecy throughput of FL clients (FCs). Specifically, when an FC performs local model training, a selected device such as a sensor node (SN) not involved in the FL opportunistically accesses the FC’s channel to transmit its sensing data. In return, when the FC sends its locally trained model to the FL server (FLS), the selected SN provides artificial jamming to increase the FC’s secrecy throughput. Considering multiple FCs and SNs, we first consider a given pairing of FCs and SNs and optimize the local training time, the model uploading time, and the transmit-power of the FCs to minimize the total latency of FL training. After proving the convexity of this optimization problem, we propose an efficient algorithm to derive the semi-analytical solution. Then, we further investigate the pairing of the FCs and the SNs to minimize a system-wise cost reflecting both energy consumption and latency. The resulting problem is a bicriteria pairing problem, and we propose an efficient algorithm to compute the optimal pairing solution. Numerical results demonstrate the efficiency and performance advantage of our proposed channel-sharing-based approach with artificial jamming in comparison with different benchmark schemes.},

Federated learning can efficiently address these issues by utilizing the data at the network edge and processing massive amounts of data in parallel at the edge devices, thus ensuring data privacy and low latency. For a large-scale federated learning task spanning many devices, challenges arise due to device heterogeneity, data variability, and limited network resources. Optimal selection of edge devices participating in federated learning is essential to attaining resilient, reliable, and resource-efficient edge networks. In this context, this article proposes an optimal device selection method to minimize redundant data training and improve network resource utilization without affecting the performance of federated learning over resource-constrained edge networks. The proposed optimal device selection method aims to minimize network resource demands while maximizing data diversity within the aggregated model. The performance of the proposed federated learning framework is evaluated using a publicly available image data set of handwritten digits, EMNIST (an extended version of the MNIST data set). Experimental results indicate that the proposed framework can obtain accuracy convergence performance on par with conventional federated learning methods while significantly reducing device usage (up to  $50\%$ ) and resource utilization (up to  $30\%$ ) while reaching 99% of achievable accuracy. The proposed method can therefore be effectively applied to resource-constrained edge networks.},

Our novel paradigm consists of three main components, i.e., (1) client-to-client trust establishment mechanism that relies on subjective and objective sources to enable clients to establish credible trust relationships toward one another; (2) trust-enabled coalitional game to enable clients to autonomously form harmonious coalitions of FL trainers; and (3) coalitional federated learning in which multiple local aggregations take place at the level of each coalition to mitigate the problems of non-IID data and communication bottleneck. Extensive experiments suggest that our solution outperforms both the standard vanilla FL approach and one state-of-the-art trust-based FL approach in terms of increasing the accuracy of the global FL model and decreasing the presence of selfish devices participating in the training.},

However, under unstable wireless channel conditions, existing WFL schemes exist the following challenges: First, learning model parameters will be disturbed by bit errors because of interference and noise during wireless transmission, which will affect the training accuracy and the loss of the learning model. Second, traditional edge devices with CPU acceleration are inefficient due to the low throughout computation, especially in accelerating the encoding and decoding process during wireless transmission. Third, current hardware-level GPU acceleration methods cannot optimize complex operations, for instance, complex wireless coding in the WFL environment. To address the above challenges, we propose a software-defined GPU-CPU empowered efficient WFL architecture with embedding LDPC communication coding. Specifically, we embed wireless channel coding into the server weight aggregation and the client local training process respectively to resist interruptions in the learning process and design a GPU-CPU acceleration scheme for this architecture. The experimental results show its anti-interference ability and GPU-CPU acceleration ability during wireless transmission, which is 10 times the error control capability and 100 times faster than existing WFL schemes.},

The first purpose of this work is to demonstrate mathematically that the traditional arithmetic-averaging model-combining approach will ultimately diverge to an unstable solution in the presence of Byzantine agents. This article also proposes a low-complexity, decentralized Byzantine resilient training mechanism. The proposed technique identifies and isolates hostile nodes rather than just mitigating their impact on the global model. In addition, the suggested approach may be used alone or in conjunction with other protection techniques to provide an additional layer of security in the event of misdetection. The suggested solution is decentralized, allowing all participating nodes to jointly identify harmful individuals using a novel cross check mechanism. To prevent biased assessments, the identification procedure is done blindly and is incorporated into the regular training process. A smart activation mechanism based on flag activation is also proposed to reduce the network overhead. Finally, general mathematical proofs combined with extensive experimental results applied in a healthcare electrocardiogram (ECG) monitoring scenario show that the proposed techniques are very efficient at accurately predicting heart problems.},

This paper aims to advance understanding in designing testbed architectures for defense mechanisms within public networks. At its core, this research introduces a unique testbed utilizing the connectivity of panOULU Municipal public network in the city of Oulu, Finland. This experimental setup examines AI-driven security across the public network.

During the training phase, a script distinguishes incoming packets as either benign or malicious based on well-defined local parameters and simulated attack scenarios. This labeled data is then utilized for training machine learning models within the Federated Learning framework, FED-ML. Subsequently, these models are evaluated on previously unseen data. The entire procedure, from traffic gathering to model training, operates without human involvement.

Existing efforts mainly focus on training multiple personalized models by adopting a global, cluster, or pairwise fashion. However, the global collaboration does not work well in case of the non-IID data distribution, cluster collaboration is often inefficient due to the single cluster pattern and high computational cost, and pairwise collaboration incurs the limitations of collaboration scope and communication efficiency. To address the problems, we propose a novel personalized FL (PFL) framework with the game-theoretic insights, called group collaboration, to overcome the shortcomings of status quo. Specifically, we first formulate the group collaboration in PFL as a multileader multifollower Stackelberg game, and then develop an $\epsilon$-better response to efficiently characterize its unique equilibrium through cautiously proposing a potential function. Since the existing equilibrium may not be optimal, we further design a Robin Hood mechanism by using the idea of transferable utility to improve the performance of the training model. Meanwhile, we also prove that the new mechanism is sustainable and can converge to a stable state with an upper bound of the training loss. Last, extensive experiments on a simulated dataset and four real-world datasets demonstrate the superiority of our proposed approach compared to the state of the art.},

However, most of these solutions have privacy concerns, especially when giving context during misbehavior analysis. Moreover, falsified or modified context generates a high percentage of false positives and sometimes causes a by-pass in misbehavior detection. Relying on the recent powerful consolidation of blockchain and federated learning (FL), we propose an efficient privacy-preserving framework for secure misbehavior detection in lightweight IoMT devices, particularly in the artificial pancreas system (APS). The proposed approach employs privacy-preserving bidirectional long-short term memory (BiLSTM) and augments the security through integrating blockchain technology based on Ethereum smart contract environment. The effectiveness of the proposed model is bench-marked empirically in terms of sustainable privacy preservation, commensurate incentive scheme with an untraceability feature, exhaustiveness, and the compact results of a variant neural network approach. As a result, the proposed model has a 99.93% recall rate, showing that it can detect virtually all possible malicious events in the targeted use case. Furthermore, given an initial ether value of 100, the solution's average gas consumption and Ether spent are 84,456.5 and 0.03157625, respectively.},

While IoT is about sensing data from physical devices, DTs reflect their digital representation and enable optimized decision-making by tightly integrating Artificial Intelligence (AI). Although swiftly growing, DTs are raising new challenges in privacy concerns, which are nowadays addressed by FL. However, the limited IoT resources, the communication overhead, and the lack of trust among clients are major obstacles that hinder the effectiveness of learning systems. In this paper, we design a new IoT-based architecture empowered by DT to improve the efficiencies of limited-resources devices. On top of this architecture, we leverage FL to construct the DT models. We further propose CISCO-FL, a Clustered FL with Intelligent Selection and Computation Offloading. Particularly, we study the computing resources of the clients and the quality of their models, and we embed in the proposed approach an intelligent offloading model, where the clients with high computational resources can assist and optimize the model of those struggling with limited resources. As such, both communication cost and computation resources are reduced and optimized. Finally, thorough experimental results are presented to support our findings and validate our model.},

  abstract     = {Since traditional federated learning (FL) algorithms cannot provide sufficient privacy guarantees, an increasing number of approaches apply local differential privacy (LDP) techniques to FL to provide strict privacy guarantees. However, the privacy budget heavily increases proportionally with the dimension of the parameters, and the large variance generated by the perturbation mechanisms leads to poor performance of the final model. In this article, we propose a novel privacy-preserving edge FL framework based on LDP (PPeFL). Specifically, we present three LDP mechanisms to address the privacy problems in the FL process. The proposed filtering and screening with exponential mechanism (FS-EM) filters out the better parameters for global aggregation based on the contribution of weight parameters to the neural network. Thus, we can not only solve the problem of fast growth of privacy budget when applying perturbation mechanism locally but also greatly reduce the communication costs. In addition, the proposed data perturbation mechanism with stronger privacy (DPM-SP) allows a secondary scrambling of the original data of participants and can provide strong security. Further, a data perturbation mechanism with enhanced utility (DPM-EU) is proposed in order to reduce the variance introduced by the perturbation. Finally, extensive experiments are performed to illustrate that the PPeFL scheme is practical and efficient, providing stronger privacy protection while ensuring utility.},

  abstract     = {The widespread adoption of Internet of Things (IoT) devices in smart cities, intelligent healthcare systems, and various real-world applications have resulted in the generation of vast amounts of data, often analyzed using different Machine Learning (ML) models. Federated learning (FL) has been acknowledged as a privacy-preserving machine learning technology, where multiple parties cooperatively train ML models without exchanging raw data. However, the current FL architecture does not allow for an audit of the training process due to the various data-protection policies implemented by each FL participant. Furthermore, there is no global model verifiability available in the current architecture. This paper proposes a smart contract-based policy control for securing the Federated Learning (FL) management system. First, we develop and deploy a smart contract-based local training policy control on the FL participants’ side. This policy control is used to verify the training process, ensuring that the evaluation process follows the same rules for all FL participants. We then enforce a smart contract-based aggregation policy to manage the global model aggregation process. Upon completion, the aggregated model and policy are stored on blockchain-based storage. Subsequently, we distribute the aggregated global model and the smart contract to all FL participants. Our proposed method uses smart policy control to manage access and verify the integrity of machine learning models. We conducted multiple experiments with various machine learning architectures and datasets to evaluate our proposed framework, such as MNIST and CIFAR-10.},

In this system, the IoT devices can collaboratively train a shared model without compromising data privacy. However, due to limited resources in the industrial IoT networks, including computational power, bandwidth, and channel state, it is challenging for many devices to accomplish local training and upload weights to the edge server in time. To address this issue, we propose a novel multi-exit-based federated edge learning (ME-FEEL) framework, where the deep model can be divided into several sub-models with different depths and output prediction from the exit in the corresponding sub-model. In this way, the devices with insufficient computational power can choose the earlier exits and avoid training the complete model, which can help reduce computational latency and enable devices to participate into aggregation as much as possible within a latency threshold. Moreover, we propose a greedy approach-based exit selection and bandwidth allocation algorithm to maximize the total number of exits in each communication round. Simulation experiments are conducted on the classical Fashion-MNIST dataset under a non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) setting, and it shows that the proposed strategy outperforms the conventional FL. In particular, the proposed ME-FEEL can achieve an accuracy gain up to 32.7% in the industrial IoT networks with the severely limited resources.},

In this article, we study joint dynamic service switching and resource allocation for multiple UAVs in MEC network. We consider the heterogeneity of tasks and UAVs and model the dynamic service process of UAVs as a sequential decision problem based on the Markovian decision process. To enable dynamic and intelligent UAV service, we first propose a centralized dynamic service algorithm DDPG-based centralized (DDBC) based on deep reinforcement learning. However, given the training difficulties of the centralized algorithm, we propose a more promising distributed learning algorithm FLBF, which combines federated learning. We conduct extensive simulations to evaluate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed algorithms. Our results show that DDBC and FLBF significantly reduce the system cost by 17.99%–35.72% and 12.30%–31.26%, respectively, compared to the comparative algorithms.

The resource-constrained nature of IIoT devices necessitates the efficient utilization of their computation and communication resources for performing FL. Additionally, the selection of an optimal set of IIoT devices by a service-provider is necessary to perform FL with a required QoS. Furthermore, to ensure the participation of the desired IIoT devices, it is necessary for the service provider to properly incentivize these devices. Although few works aim to address these issues, the possibility of partial contribution of CPU power and dataset by IIoT devices and their corresponding incentivization is overlooked by researchers. Hence, in this work, we propose FedBarg, a game-theoretic scheme, in which we model the aforementioned problem using a Nash bargaining game. We show that the corresponding optimization problem is non-convex. Thereafter, we propose a joint coalition formation game- and utility theory-based scheme to find the optimal solutions. Simulations show that FedBarg improves the incurred delay by 16.7% and revenue of the users and service provider by 14.7% and 11.1%, respectively, compared to existing benchmarks.},

Security analysis shows that MetaCIDS can efficiently detect zero-day attacks, while the training process is resistant to SPoF, data tampering, and up to 33% poisoning nodes.

It enables distributed learning to train on cross-device data, achieving efficient performance, and ensuring data privacy. In the era of Big Data, the Internet of Things (IoT), and data streaming, challenges such as monitoring and management remain unresolved. Edge IoT devices produce and stream huge amounts of sample sources, which can incur significant processing, computation, and storage costs during local updates using all data samples. Many research initiatives have improved the algorithm for FL in homogeneous networks. However, in the typical distributed learning application scenario, data is generated independently by each device, and this heterogeneous data has different distribution characteristics. As a result, the data stream, often characterized as Big Data, used by each device for local learning is unbalanced and is not independent or identically distributed. Such data heterogeneity can degrade the performance of FL and reduce resource utilization. In this paper, we present the DSS-Edge-FL, a Dynamic Sample Selection optimization algorithm that aims to optimize resources and address data heterogeneity. The extensive results of the experiment demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms the resource efficiency of conventional training methods, with a lower convergence time and improved resource efficiency.},

Hence, the Quality of Service (QoS) of clients within the Internet of Things (IoT) infrastructure can be considerably enhanced by integrating UAVs into wireless systems. However, maximizing QoS and ensuring user information security poses significant challenges in determining the trajectory of UAVs, as they need to account for the mobility and density of users. This article addresses this issue and considers a heterogeneous UAV-assisted network in which UAVs as Base Stations (BSs) have the role of finding the best trajectory based on the movement and density of Ground Users (GUs) in a way that the enhancement of the security of the covered users’ information and QoS is guaranteed. To achieve these objectives, we first introduce the Actor-Critic (AC) scheme for the optimal trajectory of UAVs due to the use of a continuous environment with a large number of states and actions. In addition, the accuracy and learning speed of the agent in AC algorithms is higher than in other Reinforcement Learning (RL) schemes. Then, the combination of ordinary Federated Learning (FL) and Distillation Federated Learning (DFL) algorithms with AC is presented to increase the security of users’ data, the learning speed of UAVs, and improve the QoS of GUs. In the FL scheme, access to the principal information of users is limited, but it cannot prevent reverse engineering techniques to attain users’ data. To intercept such incidents, we use the DFL scheme. Due to the dynamic nature of weight updating in the neural network, this method is associated with a low hacking probability. Simulation results demonstrate that utilizing FL- and DFL-AC algorithms can significantly enhance the learning speed of the proposed schemes, while increasing the downlink rate of users by approximately 1.1% and 1.5%, respectively, compared to the AC method.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as an innovative paradigm to train models among distributed agents. Conventional FL considers the center as an aggregator and trains from distributed data, while the collected global information at the center is not effectively utilized. Thus, the restricted information from local observations may limit the model accuracy. If FL can introduce data sets from the network server, the distributed models may be largely improved by the extra global information. Since network agents may not be completely trusted, the center cannot directly broadcast its raw data for security concern. Then, how to combine the central sets with FL? In this article, we propose to add a learning model at the center, which obtains the central sets as input. The outputs can be transmitted to network agents and integrated into local models instead of the raw data. The central and local models could be trained to form an integration for intelligent inference. Then, what is the integrated performance gain comparing with the original horizontal FL (HFL) and how to implement it? To figure out these two problems, we propose the vertical-HFL (VHFL) scheme, where models of the center and agents are trained collaboratively. We further analyze its convergence and the related communication channel, proposing the theoretical bounds to guide the network implementation of VHFL. Some simulation results will demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed VHFL scheme. It is expected that VHFL will be an important block for the next generation of smart services.},

However, edge servers increase the network attack surface, which is exacerbated with the massive number of connected Internet of Things (IoT) devices that can be weaponized to launch DDoS attacks. Therefore, it is crucial to detect DDoS attacks early, i.e., at the network edge. In this paper, we empower the network edge with intelligent DDoS detection by learning from similarities between different data and DDoS attacks available across the edge servers. To this end, we develop a novel Outlier Exposure (OE)-enabled cross-silo Federated Learning framework, namely FedOE. FedOE enables distributed training of OE-based ML models using a limited number of labeled outliers (i.e., attack flows) experienced at edge servers. We propose a novel OE-based Autoencoder (oAE) that can better discriminate anomalies in comparison to the widely adopted traditional Autoencoder, using a tailored, OE-based loss function. We evaluate oAE in FedOE and demonstrate its ability to generalize to zero-day attacks, with just 50 labeled attack flows per edge server. The results show that oAE achieves a high F1-score for most DDoS attacks, outclassing its non-OE counterpart.},

Still, we find that gradients attack is difficult to succeed with trajectory data. Most existing attacks have minimal effectiveness when facing models with higher nonlinearity and temporal-related characteristics, such as destination prediction models. In this article, we propose deep leakage from gradients with mobility prior (DLGMP) algorithm to solve these problems. The proposed DLGMP algorithm leverages the spatiotemporal structural information as the prior mobility knowledge, narrowing down the initial search space sharply and decreasing the difficulty of recovery. We further improve our algorithm with an easily extensible regularization term and an adversarial loss of Wasserstein GAN (WGAN) to help recover accurate and reasonable trajectories. Experiments on three mainstream data sets show good performance of our DLGMP algorithm. We also discuss several possible solutions to prevent gradients attack.},

  abstract     = {With the intelligentization of Maritime Transportation System (MTS), Internet of Thing (IoT) and machine learning technologies have been widely used to achieve the intelligent control and routing planning for ships. As an important branch of machine learning, federated learning is the first choice to train an accurate joint model without sharing ships’ data directly. However, there are still many unsolved challenges while using federated learning in IoT-enabled MTS, such as the privacy preservation and Byzantine attacks. To surmount the above challenges, a novel mechanism, namely DisBezant, is designed to achieve the secure and Byzantine-robust federated learning in IoT-enabled MTS. Specifically, a credibility-based mechanism is proposed to resist the Byzantine attack in non-iid (not independent and identically distributed) dataset which is usually gathered from heterogeneous ships. The credibility is introduced to measure the trustworthiness of uploaded knowledge from ships and is updated based on their shared information in each epoch. Then, we design an efficient privacy-preserving gradient aggregation protocol based on a secure two-party calculation protocol. With the help of a central server, we can accurately recognise the Byzantine attackers and update the global model parameters privately. Furthermore, we theoretically discussed the privacy preservation and efficiency of DisBezant. To verify the effectiveness of our DisBezant, we evaluate it over three real datasets and the results demonstrate that DisBezant can efficiently and effectively achieve the Byzantine-robust federated learning. Although there are 40% nodes are Byzantine attackers in participants, our DisBezant can still recognise them and ensure the accurate model training.},

Data sharing problems can be addressed by FL in untrusted environments, e.g., the Internet of Vehicles (IoV). However, FL needs to frequently exchange massive parameters to achieve preset model goals. In addition, the change in bandwidths and the delay of data communications due to user mobility challenge the synchronization of model parameters. In this article, an efficient hierarchical asynchronous FL (EHAFL) algorithm is proposed to adjust the encoding length dynamically according to the bandwidth and reduce the communication cost substantially. A dynamic hierarchical asynchronous aggregation mechanism is proposed leveraging gradient sparsification and asynchronous aggregation techniques to further reduce the communication costs and improve the aggregation efficiency of the global model. Simulation results on MNIST and real-world data sets show that our proposed solution can reduce the communication costs by 98% while only compromising the model accuracy by 1%.},

  abstract     = {The scarcity of fault samples has been the bottleneck for the large-scale application of mechanical fault diagnosis (FD) methods in the industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). Traditional few-shot FD methods are fundamentally limited in that the models can only learn from the direct dataset, i.e., a limited number of local data samples. Federated learning (FL) has recently shown the capacity of collaborative artificial intelligence and privacy preservation. Based on these capabilities, we propose a novel approach to solve the few-shot FD problem, which includes a generic framework (i.e., FedMeta-FFD) and an easy-to-implement enhancement technique (i.e., AILR). The FedMeta-FFD framework allows clients to learn from indirect datasets owned by other collaborators while training a global meta-learner to solve the few-shot problem directly. More concretely, with only a few labeled examples and training iterations, the global meta-learner can quickly adapt to a new client (e.g., a machine under different operating conditions) or a newly encountered fault category. Adopting AILR can significantly improve the performance of the FedMeta-FFD framework while also increasing the stability of the learning process. Further, we conduct a theoretical analysis of the proposed framework's convergence in a non-convex setting. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed FedMeta-FFD on two fault diagnosis datasets and also perform the practical validation on real-world IIoT scenarios. They demonstrate that our proposed approach achieves significantly faster convergence and higher accuracy than the existing approaches.},

Today, the deployment of FL suffers from several challenges, such as high training latency and data privacy leakage risks, especially for resource-constrained medical devices. In this article, we develop a three-layer FL architecture to decrease training latency by introducing split learning into FL. We formulate a long-term optimization problem to minimize the local model training latency while preserving the privacy of the original medical data in H-IoT. Specially, a Privacy-ware Model Partitioning Algorithm (PMPA) is proposed to solve the formulated problem based on the Lyapunov optimization theory. In PMPA, the local model is partitioned properly between a resource-constrained medical end device and an edge server, which meets privacy requirements and energy consumption constraints. The proposed PMPA is separated into two phases. In the first phase, a partition point set is obtained using Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence to meet the privacy requirement. In the second phase, we employ the model partitioning function, derived through Lyapunov optimization, to select the partition point from the partition point set that that satisfies the energy consumption constraints. Simulation results show that compared with traditional FL, the proposed algorithm can significantly reduce the local training latency. Moreover, the proposed algorithm improves the efficiency of medical image classification while ensuring medical data security.},

As a new data-sharing technology with intelligence and privacy computing, federated learning (FL) receives wide attention. It can realize data value delivery and data privacy protection at the same time, however, it lacks supervision in the application process, and the reliability of the calculation process and result transmission cannot be guaranteed. As a distributed ledger technology, blockchain has the trust property but lacks computing power. Therefore, we propose to extend the computing and supervision capabilities of blockchain with state channel, using state channel to create sandboxes and instantiate FL tasks in order to realize the trust supervision mechanism based on sandboxes. In this article, we establish an FL-based distributed data-sharing architecture and on the basis of the architecture we design a state channel-based distributed data-sharing trust supervision mechanism. Through theoretical analysis and experimental verification, the supervision mechanism we designed has an excellent performance in improving system security, resisting malicious attacks, and improving data model quality.},

As a nascent branch for trustworthy AI, federated learning (FL) has been regarded as a promising privacy preserving framework for training a global AI model over collaborative devices. However, security challenges still exist in the FL framework, e.g., Byzantine attacks from malicious devices, and model tampering attacks from malicious server, which will degrade or destroy the accuracy of trained global AI model. In this article, we shall propose a decentralized blockchain-based FL (B-FL) architecture by using a secure global aggregation algorithm to resist malicious devices, and deploying a practical Byzantine fault tolerance consensus protocol with high effectiveness and low energy consumption among multiple edge servers to prevent model tampering from the malicious server. However, to implement B-FL system at the network edge, multiple rounds of cross-validation in blockchain consensus protocol will induce long training latency. We thus formulate a network optimization problem that jointly considers bandwidth and power allocation for the minimization of long-term average training latency consisting of progressive learning rounds. We further propose to transform the network optimization problem as a Markov decision process and leverage the deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based algorithm to provide high system performance with low computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that B-FL can resist malicious attacks from edge devices and servers, and the training latency of B-FL can be significantly reduced by the DRL-based algorithm compared with the baseline algorithms.},

However, the heterogeneous data distribution in real-world environments makes it difficult to converge when performing model training. In this article, we propose the federated gradient scheduling (FedGS), an improved historical gradient sampling utilization method for optimizers that utilize historical gradients in the federated learning to alleviate the instability problem of historical gradient information due to non-IID. FedGS consists of two main steps to improve federated learning performance. First, clustering uses clients’ label distributions, which relabel clients and their submitting gradients. Second, sampling gradient clusters to generate an IID gradient set, which feeds to optimizers to derive valid momentum information. Besides, we introduce differential privacy to collaborate with FedGS to enhance clients’ privacy protection strength. Compared to previous non-IID federated learning solutions, our method can achieve greater resistance to temporal non-IID. Moreover, experiments show that FedGS can achieve faster convergence and performance gain of up to 10% over existing state-to-art methods in some scenarios. FedGS can combine with existing methods easily to achieve better performance. We further verify that our method has robust performance gains in different non-IID scenarios, demonstrating the adaptability of FedGS for different scenarios.},

As an essential prerequisite for mining potential value from these data, data sharing is crucial and getting more and more attention. However, security and privacy concerns, and the lack of effective incentive mechanisms in the decentralized environment hinder the data owners from sharing their data. In this article, we propose a federated learning (FL) and blockchain-based privacy-preserving data sharing system, which solve the privacy leakage problem of FL and the scalability problem of blockchain by their technical complementarity. Considering the resource shortage and the heterogeneity of terminals, we first design a cross-layer architecture by exploiting the cloud–edge–terminal collaboration, and innovatively propose differential data sharing by dividing the providers into origin data providers and model providers. Then, we design a targeted incentive mechanism to maximize the utility of requesters and two types of data providers by formulating it into a two-stage Stackelberg game. Finally, a gradient-based algorithm is designed to get the optimal solution. Theoretical analysis and numerical simulations show that the proposed data-sharing system could eliminate privacy concerns and motivate more participants to share data. With 500 nodes, the differentiated data sharing scheme (DASC) is 1.72 s faster than the shared model scheme (SMC) and 2.59 s faster than SDC. In terms of utility of the requester, DASC is  $2.0 \times {10^{3}}$  higher than SDC, and 9.27 higher than SMC in average utility of providers.},

A regional IoT-enabled federated learning-based HR categorization approach (IoT-FHR) incorporating global and local attributes is suggested as a solution to this issue. The local feature arterial and venous nicking (AVN) classification model is fused with the overall IoT-FHR classification model to enhance the effect of the classification of IoT-FHR. The AVN classification model’s local lesion characteristics and the IoT-FHR classification model’s global lesion characteristics were combined using feature mean. After that, the results of the global IoT-FHR classification model are averaged with the results of the local AVN classification model. An easy neural network receives its input from the final outcome. The probability value of IoT-FHR in the fundus image is output by the sigmoid classifier after the neural network’s two fully connected and one dropout layer. The AVN classification makes a new kind of intersection detection algorithm suggestion. To determine the intersection points, the algorithm applies a logical AND operation to the classified arteries and veins. It takes HR fundus pictures and extracts AVN image blocks using the region of interest extraction approach. The accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of the suggested fusion model are 93.50%, 69.83%, and 98.33%, respectively, when tested on a private dataset. It is clear from the experiments and results that the suggested model leads the currently used methods when the single-stage classification model is compared with them.},

Federated learning with a distributed learning architecture has changed this situation. By restricting the training process to participants’ local, federated learning addresses the model training needs of multiple data sources while better protecting data privacy. However, in real-world application scenarios, federated learning faces the need to achieve fairness in addition to privacy protection. In practice, it could happen that some federated learning participants with specific motives may short join the training process to obtain the current global model with only limited contribution to the federated learning whole, resulting in unfairness to the participants who previously participated in federated learning. We propose the FedACC framework with a server-initiated global model accuracy control method to address this issue. Besides measuring the accumulative contributions of newly joined participants and providing participants with a model with an accuracy that matches their contributions, the FedACC still guarantees the validity of participant gradients based on the accuracy-decayed model. Under the FedACC framework, users do not have access to the full version of the current global model early in their training participation. However, they must produce a certain amount of contributions before seeing the full-accuracy model. We introduce an additional differential privacy mechanism to protect clients’ privacy further. Experiments demonstrate that the FedACC could obtain about 10%–20% accuracy gain compared to the state-of-the-art methods while balancing the fairness, performance, and security of federated learning.},

  abstract     = {The advancement of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) technology has resulted in the fourth industrial revolution, or Industry 4.0, enabling industries to enhance productivity. However, despite the benefits, there remain significant challenges, such as resource heterogeneity, communication efficiency, and data privacy, that limit the applications of IIoT in privacy-sensitive domains like healthcare. In order to protect data privacy, Federated Learning (FL) has been suggested as a solution, involving the sharing of model parameters rather than data itself. Current FL applications, however, still struggle with cost efficiency, especially when IIoT devices with heterogenous resources are involved. To address this, this paper proposes Digital Twin (DT) enabled Asynchronous SplitFed Learning (DT-ASFL) for classification tasks in the e-healthcare system over mobile networks. We first develop SplitFed Learning to introduce communication efficiency in the e-healthcare system, sending only extracted features during the learning process instead of the entire learning model. This enables resource-constrained devices to participate in the learning process by allowing the participants to train a partial learning model. DT is then employed to provide real-time statuses of IIoT devices deployed in the system, enabling asynchronous model updates in SplitFed Learning. The experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of DT-ASFL compared to the existing methods.},

We propose an adaptive differential privacy-based federated learning framework for building a collaborative network intrusion detection system model for EV charging stations (EVCS). We use utility optimized local differential privacy to provide data privacy to the local network traffic data of each EVCS. Moreover, we propose a reinforcement learning-based intelligent privacy allocation mechanism at the EVCS level. The main significance of the proposed mechanism is that it can make privacy provisioning adaptive to the extent of privacy breaching rate, and dynamically optimize the privacy budget and the utility to avoid human intervention such as domain knowledge experts. The experimental results confirm the efficacy of our proposed mechanism and achieves appropriate privacy provisioning accuracy to approximately 95%.},

  abstract     = {Federated Learning (FL) empowers Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) with distributed intelligence of industrial automation thanks to its capability of distributed machine learning without any raw data exchange. However, it is rather challenging for lightweight IIoT devices to perform computation-intensive local model training over large-scale deep neural networks (DNNs). Driven by this issue, we develop a communication-computation efficient FL framework for resource-limited IIoT networks that integrates DNN partition technique into the standard FL mechanism, wherein IIoT devices perform local model training over the bottom layers of the objective DNN, and offload the top layers to the edge gateway side. Considering imbalanced data distribution, we derive the device-specific participation rate to involve the devices with better data distribution in more communication rounds. Upon deriving the device-specific participation rate, we propose to minimize the training delay under the constraints of device-specific participation rate, energy consumption and memory usage. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem of device scheduling and resource allocation (i.e. DNN partition point, channel assignment, transmit power, and computation frequency), and solve the long-term min-max mixed integer non-linear programming based on the Lyapunov technique. In particular, the proposed dynamic device scheduling and resource allocation (DDSRA) algorithm can achieve a trade-off to balance the training delay minimization and FL performance. We also provide the FL convergence bound for the DDSRA algorithm with both convex and non-convex settings. Experimental results demonstrate the derived device-specific participation rate in terms of feasibility, and show that the DDSRA algorithm outperforms baselines in terms of test accuracy and convergence time.},

Under this umbrella, the edge intelligence is ready to propel another ripple in the industrial growth by ensuring the next generation of connectivity and performance. With the recent proliferation of blockchain, edge intelligence enters a new era, where each edge trains the local learning model, then interconnecting the whole learning models in a distributed blockchain manner, known as blockchain-assisted federated learning. However, it is quiet challenging task to provide secure edge intelligence in 5G-enabled IIoT environment alongside ensuring latency and throughput. In this article, we propose a proof-of-learning consensus protocol that considers the reputation opinion for edge blockchain to ensure secure and trustworthy edge intelligence in IIoT. This protocol fetches each edge’s reputation opinion by executing a smart contract, and partly adopts the winner’s learning model according to its reputation opinion. By quantitative performance analysis and simulation experiments, the proposed scheme demonstrates the superior performance in contrast to the traditional counterparts.},

Designing an efficient intrusion detection system (IDS) model is imperative. However, when creating IDS models with distributed data collected by UAVs, it is necessary to take precautions to protect the data’s security and privacy. Furthermore, most of the IDS models are focused on one-time learning but not on continuous learning. To this end, we propose a federated continuous learning framework with a stacked broad learning system (FCL-SBLS) based on the digital twin network (DTN), which can learn and train the IDS model on new data quickly and continuously. In order to improve the efficiency and quality of the IDS model when training and aggregation, we employ an asynchronous federated learning (FL) architecture, and a deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG)-based UAV selection scheme assisted by DTN is proposed to help the global IDS model aggregation. The presented algorithm is validated using the CIC-IDS2017 data set, and the simulation results reveal that our algorithm achieves higher efficiency and accuracy than the existing FL scheme.},

However, the eavesdropper can recover data from parameters or gradients, resulting in data leakage. To defend against eavesdropping attacks, in this article, we propose an algorithm that divides the transmit power proportionally between the transmitted signal and artificial noise (AN) to counteract the eavesdropper for wireless FL. In this algorithm, due to the limited communication resources, the ratio of signal power to total power and the aggregation frequency need to be carefully chosen, to guarantee the model accuracy and security at the same time. In order to achieve this goal, we maximize the secrecy rate with the system/user power and model performance constraints. To make this problem tractable, we derive two bounds of the secrecy rate and loss function, which allows us to obtain closed-form expressions for the power of AN and the aggregation frequency. Furthermore, in order to make our analysis more realistic, we consider the FL model with channel fading and additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) over uplink and downlink, respectively. Specifically, we discuss the convergence of FL over noisy multiple access channels (MACs). Simulation results confirm the convergence and the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.},

Due to limited wireless subchannels, a subset of the total clients is scheduled in each iteration of federated learning algorithms. On the other hand, the scheduled clients wait for the slowest client to finish its computation. We propose to first cluster the clients based on the time they need per iteration to compute the local gradients of the federated learning model. Then, we schedule a mixture of clients from all clusters to send their local updates in a pipelined manner. In this way, instead of just waiting for the slower clients to finish their computations, more clients can participate in each iteration. While the time duration of a single iteration does not change, the proposed method can significantly reduce the number of required iterations to achieve a target accuracy. We provide a generic formulation for optimal client clustering under different settings, and we analytically derive an efficient algorithm for obtaining the optimal solution. We also provide numerical results to demonstrate the gains of the proposed method for different data sets and deep learning architectures.},

This article proposes a privacy-preserving and verifiable federated learning method called PPVerifier to support privacy protection and verification of aggregated results in the cloud-edge collaborative computing environment. By the integrating Paillier homomorphic encryption and random number generation technique, all gradients and their ciphertexts can be protected. Meanwhile, an additive secret-sharing scheme is introduced to resist potential collusion attacks among the aggregation server, malicious participants, and edge nodes. Moreover, a verification scheme based on discrete logarithm is proposed, which can not only verify the correctness of aggregated results, but also discover lazy aggregation servers, and the verification overhead can be reduced by over half compared with a bilinear aggregate signature method. Finally, theoretical analysis and experiments conducted on the MNIST data set prove that our proposed method can achieve gradient protection and correctness verification of the aggregated results with higher efficiency.},

The federated paradigm resolves this challenge by performing tasks collaboratively without uploading the raw data. However, the inherent data heterogeneity (skewness) of diverse industrial IoT data holders significantly degrades the performances of all kinds of federated industrial IoT learning tasks. Quantifying this skewness is non-trivial and cannot be solved by the existing federated learning techniques. In this paper, we propose a Federated skewness Analytics and Client Selection mechanism (FedACS) to quantify the data skewness in a privacy preserving way and use this information to help downstream federated learning tasks. FedACS provably estimates the skewness of the clients using the Hoeffding's inequality based on the distilled insights of edge data in the form of gradient. It then gracefully handles the drifting estimation and robustly selects clients with milder skewness using a novel dueling bandit approach. FedACS gains advantages in privacy preservation, infrastructure reuse, and optimized overheads. Extensive experiments on open datasets demonstrate that FedACS reduces the accuracy degradation by $\sim$78.2%, and accelerates the FL convergence for $\sim 2.4\times$.},

Further, in order to address the problem of data silos, we adopt federated learning to jointly train the classification models of different hospitals to obtain a global model and realize data sharing among different hospitals. Finally, we use the optimal classification of patients for task deployment on the blockchain, and limit patients to only apply for tasks of the corresponding level through the smart contract technology, so as to protect task privacy. Experimental results show that our strategy can not only effectively protect task and patient privacy, but also achieve better system performance.},

However, existing methods often rely on relaxing the low-rank constraint of the model weights using a regularized nuclear norm penalty, which requires an appropriate hyperparameter that can be difficult to determine in practice. Furthermore, existing compression techniques are not directly applicable to efficient over-the-air (OTA) aggregation in federated learning (FL) systems for distributed Internet-of-Things (IoT) scenarios. In this article, we propose a novel manifold optimization formulation for low-rank model compression in FL that does not relax the low-rank constraint. Our optimization is conducted directly over the low-rank manifold, guaranteeing that the model is exactly low-rank. We also introduce a consensus penalty in the optimization formulation to support OTA aggregation. Based on our optimization formulation, we propose an alternating Riemannian optimization algorithm with a precoder that enables efficient OTA aggregation of low-rank local models without sacrificing training performance. Additionally, we provide convergence analysis in terms of key system parameters and conduct extensive experiments with real-world datasets to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed Riemannian low-rank model compression scheme compared to various state-of-the-art baselines.},

  abstract     = {Machine learning (ML)-based physical layer authentication (PLA) has attracted much attention since neural networks can be constructed to identify channel characteristics in complex wireless environments. This enables high-authentication performance and lightweight deployment in the Internet of Things (IoTs). Due to the booming growth of IoT connections, the workload of the central authenticator increases significantly. As a result, resource-constrained terminals are unable to independently handle the computationally complex ML task. Therefore, cooperative PLA (CoPLA), which introduces multiple supervised nodes as task-sharing entities, is emerged as a promising solution to address this concern. However, in existing CoPLA studies, some critical issues have been overlooked. For example, the consideration of which collaborative nodes are eligible or best suited for cooperation to maximize the authentication gains. Moreover, the security threats posed by untrusted collaborators are equally challenging. In this article, we propose a federated learning (FL)-based CoPLA scheme that utilizes a group of edge devices to jointly build an authenticator. This ensures privacy preservation and higher robustness. To figure out the optimal collaborator selection in CoPLA, an adaptive search procedure via reinforcement learning (RL) is customized. Furthermore, we introduce a lightweight reputation estimation method to evaluate each collaborator’s credibility, thereby uncovering underperforming devices or hidden internal attackers. Finally, simulations and real-world experiments are carried out. The results show that the authentication accuracy of our scheme is 9.52% higher than that of blind cooperation. And, it outperforms other existing CoPLA schemes in terms of time efficiency and robustness.},

  abstract     = {Payload-based anomaly detection (PAD) model is commonly built upon a big data of normal payload samples, and hence is able to discover zero-day attacks and unknown faults without the need of any negative samples in training phase. But such detection model encounters new challenges to adapt well to the emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). That is, the modern industrial processes are usually running in a very high complexity, resulting the payloads much more complex and diverse. Further, the industrial data is likely too sensitive to be shared in public, and thus induces a new privacy concern. To tackle these challenges, we propose  ${\mathrm{ P}}^{3}{\mathrm{ AD}}$ , a novel privacy-preserved payload-based anomaly detection model for IIoT. The basic idea is to train a two-dimensional convolutional neural network (2D-CNN) based auto-encoder using normal payloads over a federated GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) architecture, and then to detect anomalies by an unexpected dissimilarity between the original payloads and the payloads reconstructed by the auto-encoder. By the 2D-CNN, we can model the normal payloads from both the request and response directions simultaneously, and thus have more opportunities to capture the complex and dynamic industrial behaviors that are possibly reflected in the bi-directional network communications. By the GAN, we can train a more generalized auto-encoder that is able to reconstruct more general payload samples without the need to have them in advance for model training. By the federated architecture, we can remove the need of direct sharing of normal payloads, and learn them indirectly by aggregating local models across different industrial data owners, hence ensuring the payload privacy. We have evaluated  ${\mathrm{ P}}^{3}{\mathrm{ AD}}$  using four public industrial payload datasets as well as considering four typical IIoT PAD scenarios. The detection results achieve more than 0.966 in terms of F1 score for global condition and at least 0.753 for all kinds of federated settings, proving the effectiveness of our  ${\mathrm{ P}}^{3}{\mathrm{ AD}}$  with privacy preserved.},

The quality of the local model submitted by the data holder determines the quality of the global model in FL, and the quality of the local model depends on the data quantity, data quality, and computing power of the data holder. However, in the process of model training, the data holder will inevitably spend the cost of communication and local model training, and higher quality data acquisition and higher quality local model training require higher cost. Therefore, how to motivate data holders with a large amount of high-quality data and computing power to participate in FL has become an urgent problem to be solved. This article transforms the problem of motivating data holders into an optimization problem of utility from the perspective of maximizing the utility of the data holder, establishes the incentive mechanism based on the Contract Theory, and proves that the optimal strategy set of the data holders reaches Nash Equilibrium. A large number of experiments based on public data sets of UCI and MNIST verify that the incentive mechanism can make the baseline algorithm converge faster, while resisting malicious behaviors, such as free-riding and collusive attacks. Furthermore, the data holder with a large amount of high-quality data and computing power can obtain higher revenue.},

  abstract     = {With the digital transformation of the energy industry, energy blockchain is playing an important role in application areas, such as energy data sharing and distributed power trading. In this process, the use of energy data is a top priority. Federated learning (FL) can enable the analysis and computation of energy data while protecting their privacy. However, traditional FL relies on a central server and parties involved are not fully trusted. In energy blockchain environment, FL also faces data poisoning attacks launched by energy departments, besides, the supervisory committee carrying out checking models can launch deception attacks. Therefore, we propose a game theory-based incentive mechanism for collaborative security of FL in energy blockchain environment, which can discourage nodes from taking malicious behaviors in iterative training of FL. First, we propose an FL model in energy blockchain environment, which can protect privacy and achieve collaborative security. Considering that game theory can be used to analyze the strategies of participants, we build a game model with energy departments and supervisory committee as players and design our incentive mechanism based on game theory, which is implemented by smart contracts. Even if the accuracy of model checking algorithm is low, malicious behaviors in FL can be reduced by using our incentive mechanism. In particular, we prove that our mechanism can lead game model to a Nash equilibrium (NE) that achieve collaborative security. Security analysis and experimental evaluation show that our incentive mechanism is feasible in energy blockchain with robustness, reliability, and low complexity.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) nowadays are developing rapidly for various applications such as UAV taxis and delivery drones. However, the limited battery energy restricts the flight distance of the UAVs. Thus, urban prosumers equipped with drone recharge stations are introduced to provide charging services for the UAVs. In this article, first, a day-ahead energy scheduling problem for UAV charging-enabled urban prosumers is studied, where the objective is to maximize the overall energy satisfaction of the prosumers with ensuring the Quality of Service (QoS) of the charged UAVs. Specifically, to deal with the considered problem, we decompose it into two stages: 1) the day-ahead energy requirement data prediction stage and 2) energy scheduling stage per prosumer. Thus, second, a joint method based on hierarchical federated learning (HFL) on long short-term memory (LSTM) architecture (HFL-LSTM) and stochastic game-based multi-agent double deep  $Q$ -learning (MADDQN) with community agent-independent approach is proposed. In particular, the HFL-LSTM approach is leveraged to forecast each prosumer’s energy requirement data without centralized collecting local prosumers’ data such that to protect data privacy. Then, the stochastic game is adopted to analyze the formulated problem, aiming to find the Nash equilibrium (NE) strategy. Afterward, MADDQN with a community agent-independent method is utilized to achieve the best energy scheduling strategy per prosumer. Finally, the experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed joint method that can achieve the lowest mean squared error with the value of 0.0152 and the highest energy satisfaction  $(36388)$  achieved by the NE policy compared with the benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Online federated learning (FL) enables geographically distributed devices to learn a global shared model from locally available streaming data. Most online FL literature considers a best case scenario regarding the participating clients and the communication channels. However, these assumptions are often not met in real-world applications. Asynchronous settings can reflect a more realistic environment, such as heterogeneous client participation due to available computational power and battery constraints, as well as delays caused by communication channels or straggler devices. Further, in most applications, energy efficiency must be taken into consideration. Using the principles of partial-sharing-based communications, we propose a communication-efficient asynchronous online FL (PAO-Fed) strategy. By reducing the communication load of the participants, the proposed method renders participation more accessible and efficient. In addition, the proposed aggregation mechanism accounts for random participation, handles delayed updates, and mitigates their effect on accuracy. We study the first- and second-order convergence of the proposed PAO-Fed method and obtain an expression for its steady-state mean square deviation. Finally, we conduct comprehensive simulations to study the performance of the proposed method on both synthetic and real-life data sets. The simulations reveal that in asynchronous settings, the proposed PAO-Fed is able to achieve the same convergence properties as that of the online federated stochastic gradient while reducing the communication by 98%.},

  abstract     = {Massive amounts of high-quality data are the prerequisite and support for AI technologies. Due to the nature of privacy-preserving and low communication overheads, federated learning (FL) has garnered considerable attention in comparison with traditional data collection methods. However, the performance of FL is hampered by the lack of interested clients and limited local data due to selfishness and individual behavioral preferences. To this end, we propose PractFL, a proactive and distributed framework that incorporates the concept of mobile crowdsensing into the FL paradigm. Specifically, we design an incentive mechanism in the form of virtual red packets, which are a widely used way of monetary reward and gift-giving in social lives. In this article we extend this further by giving meaning to the locations, i.e., the red packets are only accessible at specific places. The virtual red packets’ locations and monetary amounts can be dynamically updated by the cloud center to encourage clients to collect additional data that may benefit the FL process. Further, we propose a distributed behavioral decision engine based on multiarmed bandits (i.e., choose which red packet to go for) in response to the incentive mechanism enforced by the cloud. Considering the movement cost and conflicts with other clients,  $K$ -anonymity and probabilistic selection are introduced in the distributed behavioral decision to recommend the optimal red packet choice for clients without revealing their privacy. The experimental results demonstrate that PractFL outperforms the baselines in terms of classification accuracy. We also find that PractFL can effectively alleviate the overfitting problem caused by class imbalance during the training.},

  abstract     = {With increasingly strict data privacy regulations, federated learning (FL) has become one of the most often heard machine learning techniques due to its privacy-preserving trait. To efficiently implement the FL intelligence, researchers recently resort to a newly emerged computing paradigm, mobile-edge computing (MEC), and bring about a burst of works. However, most existing works neglect practical issues in MEC systems, e.g., device heterogeneity, unstable channel conditions, and unknown user mobility. Any of them, if not handled properly, can cause fatal failures to FL. This article proposed a novel FL framework, called multicore FL (MC-FL), to help FL intelligence land successfully on realistic MEC systems. A distinct feature of MC-FL is maintaining and training multiple global models (GMs) that exhibit different tradeoffs between learning performances and computational complexity. While this modification seems simple, it can effectively handle the device heterogeneity and device status variations, and improve the compatibility and robustness of FL. Furthermore, MC-FL employs a partial client participation scheme that allows participating clients to vary across time. This enables MC-FL to function under uncertain mobile environments. We rigorously prove the convergence of the designed MC-FL framework. In particular, we propose an online client scheduling scheme for MC-FL to judiciously schedule clients for training multiple GMs in a manner that minimizes the completion time of MC-FL. We also provide a service provisioning scenario with MC-FL to show how service subscribers could benefit from multiple GMs and improve their Quality of Experience (QoE). We evaluate our method on real-world data sets, and the results show that MC-FL outperforms state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

First, we employ dual generative adversarial networks to address the problem of insufficient data. In addition, to improve the quality of generated images, we synchronously optimize the sharpness of images, Frechet inception distance, image diversity, and loss using knee point-driven evolutionary algorithm (KnEA).

The experiment results demonstrate that the accuracy and area under the curve reach 91% and 88%, respectively. This model can help resolve problems of insufficient data in smart medicine of IoT and protect the privacy of user data while also providing an excellent detection rate.},

The participating clients for cross-device settings, in general, have heterogeneous system capabilities and limited communication bandwidth. Such practical properties of the edge-devices, however, are overlooked by many recent work in PFL, which use the same model architecture across all clients and incur high communication cost by directly communicating the model parameters. In our work, we propose a novel and practical PFL framework named COMET where clients can use heterogeneous models of their own choice and do not directly communicate their model parameters to other parties. Instead, COMET uses clustered codistillation, where clients use knowledge distillation to transfer their knowledge to other clients with similar data distributions. This presents a practical PFL framework for the edge-devices to train through IoT networks by lifting the heavy communication burden of communicating large models. We theoretically show the convergence and generalization properties of COMET and empirically show that COMET achieves high test accuracy with several orders of magnitude lower communication cost while allowing client model heterogeneity compared to the other state-of-the-art PFL methods.},

Through the analysis of the security, it shows that the proposed scheme satisfies data privacy. Computation cost and communication cost are also analyzed theoretically.

This article proposes a service provision method based on service function chaining (SFC) to solve this problem. Network function virtualization (NFV) is essential for efficient resource allocation in SAGIN to meet the resource requirements of user service requests. We propose a federated learning (FL)-based algorithm to solve the embedding problem of SFCs in SAGIN. The algorithm considers different characteristics of nodes and resource load to balance resource consumption. Then, an SFC scheduling mechanism is proposed that allows SFC reconfiguration to reduce the service blocking rate. Simulation results show that our proposed FL-VNFE algorithm is more advantageous compared to other algorithms, with 12.9%, 2.52%, and 10.5% improvement in long-term average revenue, acceptance rate, and long-term average revenue–cost ratio, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Traditional federated learning (FL) adopts a client-server architecture where FL clients (e.g., IoT edge devices) train a common global model with the help of a centralized orchestrator (cloud server). However, current approaches are moving away from centralized orchestration toward a decentralized one in order to fully adapt FL for a cross-silo configuration with multiple organizations acting as clients. State-of-the-art decentralized FL mechanisms make at least one of the following assumptions: 1) clients are trusted organizations and cannot inject low-quality model updates for aggregation and 2) client local models can be shared with other clients or a third party for verification of low-quality updates. This article proposes a Blockchain-based decentralized framework for scenarios where participatory organizations are believed to be fully capable of injecting low-quality model updates as they are not willing to expose their local models to any other entity for verification purpose. The proposed decentralized FL framework adopts a novel hierarchical network of aggregators with the ability to punish/reward organizations in proportion to their local model quality updates. The framework is flexible and unlike state-of-the-art solutions, prevents a single entity from possessing the aggregated model in any FL round of training. The proposed framework is tested with respect to off-chain and on-chain performance in two Industry 4.0 use cases: 1) predictive maintenance and 2) product visual inspection. A comparative evaluation against the state-of-the-art reveals the proposed framework’s utility in terms of minimizing model convergence time and latency while maximizing accuracy and throughput.},

However, the traditional AI technologies may lead to the leakage of patient privacy data due to its own design flaws. As a privacy-preserving federated learning (FL) can generate a global disease diagnosis model through multiparty collaboration. However, FL is still unable to resist inference attacks. In this article, to address such problems, we propose a privacy-enhanced disease diagnosis mechanism using FL for IoMT. Specifically, we first reconstruct medical data through a variational autoencoder and add differential privacy noise to it to resist inference attacks. These data are then used to train local disease diagnosis models, thereby preserving patients' privacy. Furthermore, to encourage participation in FL, we propose an incentive mechanism to provide corresponding rewards to participants. Experiments are conducted on the arrhythmia database Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Beth Israel Hospital (MIT-BIH). The experimental results show that the proposed mechanism reduces the probability of reconstructing patient medical data while ensuring high-precision heart disease diagnosis.},

  abstract     = {Video data is the biggest IoT data which is challenging for effective analysis with good performance. Object misdetection is usually inevitable in edge-based distributed cross-scene video analysis. Traditional centralized model training can potentially result in edge data leakage. Even though joint model can be trained with federated learning while maintaining data privacy, the size of gradient data transmitted is large for computer vision models used. To address these problems, this article proposed an accurate and efficient federated learning-based edge intelligence for effective video analysis method called EIEVA-AEFL. In EIEVA-AEFL, a federation misdetection reinforcement network (FMRN) is designed to alleviate the misdetection problem. FMRN contains a vanilla object detection network and a misdetection reinforcement branch, which finetunes object detection via feature re-extraction to reduce object misdetection. To reduce the communication cost in training, an efficient federated learning strategy is designed. In this strategy, an oscillation suppression loss function is proposed to suppress the loss fluctuation resulting from data on edge clients. Average accuracy and recall increase 0.5 and 0.7 with FMRN on the Microsoft common objects in context (MS COCO) data set, respectively, and with improvements of 4.5 and 5.5 with FMRN on our self-made mis-detection data set, respectively. EIEVA-AEFL can reduce the training speed on the premise of ensuring the accuracy of the model. The model parameters, data amount, transmission delay, and convergence epochs on EIEVA-AEFL model training are reduced by 78%, 89%, 84%, and 36%, respectively.},

A group of sensing clients can collaboratively leverage their private, local fingerprint data to help their edge server update a location prediction model. However, it is challenging to jointly handle the two involved issues, i.e., building-floor classification (BFC) and latitude–longitude regression (LLR), in a wide 3-D space through enabling FL on decentralized yet heterogeneous data and over an imperfect wireless network. In this article, we confront these challenges and propose an FL framework, FedLoc3D, for both BFC and LLR. Specifically, the former issue is addressed by an FedDSC-BFC approach, which generates a multilabel classification model based on a convolutional neural network with depthwise separable convolutions. The latter issue is addressed by an FedADA-LLR approach, which develops a multitarget regression model based on a deep neural network with autoencoder and data augmentation. Extensive experiments on a real-world data set of WiFi fingerprints are carried out, and our approaches with enhanced capabilities of feature extraction, generalization, and convergence are validated to improve both localization accuracy and learning efficiency under data heterogeneity and network instability.},

  abstract     = {Blockchain (BC) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have independent applications in multiple industries, including banking, finance, healthcare, construction, transportation, hospitality, manufacturing, and insurance, to name a few. Moreover, these two technologies can be integrated seamlessly, thanks to their complementary and mutually supportive features. AI algorithms can make the medical BC storage efficient by their processing algorithms, also playing the role of knowledgeable gatekeepers. BC can support AI models by providing secure, sizeable, traceable, diverse, and immutable healthcare data for the training purpose. The integration of BC and AI has multiple use cases in the healthcare industry ranging from disease prediction to pandemic management. Previously, researchers have reviewed the applications of each of these technologies in healthcare independently. Although the integration of BC and AI has been fruitful, to the best of our knowledge, there has been no work in the past reviewing the confluence of these two technologies in the healthcare sector. We have classified the works based on two different classification schemes: 1) application-based and 2) AI-training paradigm-based classification. We have also provided a compilation of tools used in the integrated systems of BC and AI for healthcare. We identified that the integration of BC and AI technologies had been applied in quite different areas of healthcare ranging from biomedical research to pandemic management. It is also noted that the supervised learning algorithms and federated learning paradigm for secure decentralized AI model training are often used in the integration. Our findings reveal that majority of the reviewed works use BC as a secure database for AI models. Furthermore, we also have pointed out the potential applications of these two technologies in healthcare.},

The key to efficient caching is to predict the content popularity accurately while touching the users’ privacy as little as possible. Recently, many studies have applied federated learning in content caching to improve data security. However, they still give away some privacy of participants, especially ignoring the private data leakage in the trained model. To solve this problem and further improve the cache hit ratio, we propose an efficient content popularity prediction of privacy-preserving (CPPPP) scheme based on federated learning and Wasserstein generative adversarial network (WGAN), which achieves a high cache hit ratio. Benefited by the Federated-WGAN and the generated fake samples, the private data, the content preferences of individual users, and so on are well protected. In particular, gradient clipping and model parameter limitation are introduced in the model training, and the security of the modified model is greatly improved compared with the original model. Results show that the proposed scheme has a higher cache hit ratio than the existing federated learning-based methods while limiting the privacy leakage caused by the trained model to a quite low level.},

To enable intelligent service in WCPN, we design a task and resource-aware federated learning model, coined FedTAR, which minimizes the sum energy consumption of all computing nodes by the joint optimization of the computing strategies of individual computing nodes and their collaborative learning strategy. Based on the solution of the optimization problem, the neural network depth of computing nodes and the collaboration frequency among nodes are adjustable according to specific computing task requirements and resource constraints. To further adapt to heterogeneous computing nodes, we then propose an energy-efficient asynchronous aggregation algorithm for FedTAR, which accelerates the convergence speed of federated learning in WCPN. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme outperforms the existing studies in terms of learning accuracy, convergence rate, and energy saving.},

In this article, we study energy-aware DNN model training in edge computing. We first formulate a novel energy-aware, Device-to-Device (D2D) assisted federated learning problem with the aim to minimize the global loss of a training DNN model, subject to bandwidth capacity on an edge server and energy capacity on each IoT device. We then devise a near-optimal learning algorithm for the problem when the training data follows the i.i.d. data distribution. The crux of the proposed algorithm is to explore using the energy of neighboring devices of each device for its local model uploading, by reducing the problem to a series of weighted maximum matching problems in corresponding auxiliary graphs. We also consider the problem without the assumption of the i.i.d. data distribution, for which we propose an efficient heuristic algorithm. We finally evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms through experimental simulations. Experimental results show that the proposed algorithms are promising.},

However, it usually needs to collect massive power load data on the server and may face the problem of privacy leakage of raw data. Federated learning can enhance the privacy of the raw power load data of clients by frequently transmitting model updates. Concerning the increasing communication burden of resource-heterogeneous clients resulting from frequent communication with the server, a communication-efficient federated learning algorithm based on Compressed Model Updates and Lazy uploAd (CMULA-FL) was proposed to reduce the communication cost. CMULA-FL also integrates the error compensation strategy to improve the model utility. First, the compression operator is used to compress the transmitted model updates, of which large norms are uploaded to reduce the communication cost of each epoch and transmission frequency. Second, by measuring the error of compression and lazy upload, the error is accumulated to the next epoch to improve the model utility. Finally, based on simulation experiments on the benchmark power load data, the results show that the communication cost decreases at least 60% with controlled loss of model prediction compared with baseline.},

However, local models are proved to imply the information about the private data and, thus, introduce much vulnerabilities to inference attacks where the adversary reconstructs or infers the sensitive information about the private data (e.g., labels, memberships, etc.) from the local models. To address this issue, existing works proposed homomorphic encryption, secure multiparty computation (SMC), and differential privacy methods. Nevertheless, the homomorphic encryption and SMC-based approaches are not applicable to large-scale FL scenarios as they incur substantial additional communication and computation costs and require secure channels to delivery keys. Moreover, differential privacy brings a substantial tradeoff between privacy budget and model performance. In this article, we propose a novel FL framework, which can protect the data privacy of worker devices against the inference attacks with minimal accuracy cost and low computation and communication cost, and does not rely on the secure pairwise communication channels. The main idea is to generate the lightweight keys based on computational Diffie–Hellman (CDH) problem to encrypt the local models, and the FL server can only get the sum of the local models of all worker devices without knowing the exact local model of any specific worker device. The extensive experimental results on three real-world data sets validate that the proposed FL framework can protect the data privacy of worker devices, and only incurs a small constant of computation and communication cost and a drop in test accuracy of no more than 1%.},

In this work, we present a two-pronged approach to overcome the limitations of existing wireless machine learning (ML)-based algorithms. First, to tackle the effect of channel noise, we incorporate a novel tracking-based stochastic approximation scheme in the standard federated averaging pipeline which averages out the effect of the channel noise. In contrast to previous works on FL with a noisy channel, we provide exact convergence guarantees for our algorithm without the need to increase the transmission power gain. Second, to combat channel fading and further optimize the power consumption at the client level, we propose an adaptive transmission policy obtained by solving an optimization problem with long-term constraints. The solution is obtained in an online manner via a dual decomposition method. The superior empirical performance of the proposed scheme compared to state-of-the-art works is demonstrated on standard ML tasks.},

Recently, FL has been interpreted within a model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) framework, which brings FL significant advantages in fast adaptation and convergence over heterogeneous data sets. However, existing research simply combines MAML and FL without explicitly addressing how much benefit MAML brings to FL and how to maximize such benefit over mobile-edge networks. In this article, we quantify the benefit from two aspects: 1) optimizing FL hyperparameters (i.e., sampled data size and the number of communication rounds) and 2) resource allocation (i.e., transmit power) in mobile-edge networks. Specifically, we formulate the MAML-based FL design as an overall learning time minimization problem, under the constraints of model accuracy and energy consumption. Facilitated by the convergence analysis of MAML-based FL, we decompose the formulated problem and then solve it using analytical solutions and the coordinate descent method. With the obtained FL hyperparameters and resource allocation, we design an MAML-based FL algorithm, called automated FL (AutoFL), that is able to conduct fast adaptation and convergence. Extensive experimental results verify that AutoFL outperforms other benchmark algorithms regarding the learning time and convergence performance.},

Certain critical applications, such as emergency alert relays, as well as industrial floor evacuation and surveillance systems, require fresh updates that can maintain the most recently delivered packets. This requires high reconfigurability to an extent where the system can measure the impact of an event and adapt the network accordingly. Recent research has demonstrated that network failures can undermine the sustainability of Industry 4.0 or Industrial IoT in general. In this paper, we design an intelligent Federated learning based Time-Sensitive Networking (Fed-TSN) controller framework to optimize the failure recovery. In industrial IoT scenarios, such as emergency evacuations on factory floors due to natural disasters, there can be multiple link failures with no disjoint paths which require a sustainable recovery solution. Accordingly, we consider multiple simultaneous link failures, both for networks with and without disjoint paths. The typically probabilistic network failures on a factory floor call for designing a mechanism that can search for routes with minimum joint failure probability (JFP). We formulate the JFP minimization problem as a non-linear integer program. We design a Software Defined Networking (SDN) controller that runs an application to produce near-optimal solutions for providing enhanced sustainability in a wide range of Industry 4.0 scenarios. We employ this non-linear integer program solution as input to our intelligent Fed-TSN fault recovery strategy that predicts the migration location based on the changes in the TSN gate schedule. We conduct simulations to quantify the improvements achieved with Fed-TSN compared to state-of-the-art approaches.},

However, when participants collect and upload sensing data in MCS system, they often overlap in time and space. Therefore, MCS system obtains a lot of redundant data, and ultimately cannot meet the MCS task requirements. Meanwhile, existing schemes cannot realize the dynamic allocation of sensing tasks and the dynamic selection of task participants. In addition, task participants will generate and transfer a large amount of sensitive information, such as location, identity, personal habits, etc., in the process of uploading sensing data and completing sensing tasks, thus leading to the risk of privacy leakage. Presently, many schemes use federated learning and other technologies to protect privacy, but there are still challenges that adversaries can extract parameters information during model training. Therefore, in order to the above problems, this article puts forward an efficient and secure MCS framework FRNet in Internet of Vehicles (IoVs). Specifically, MCS task completion is described as a two-phase process. This article not only proposes a method to dynamically select candidate participants in MCS vehicular networks to collect high-quality sensing data, but also establishes a data privacy protection mechanism for the whole process of model training in federated learning. Finally, the effectiveness of FRNet is verified through security analysis and experimental evaluation. Experimental results show that FRNet can effectively improve the quality of sensing data, maximize TCV, and enhance data privacy protection ability.},

Fortunately, rapidly developing deep learning technology has shown its potential in distracted driving detection.

As a privacy-preserving distributed learning paradigm, federated learning (FL) has achieved competitive performance in many applications recently. Inspired by this, we introduce FL into distracted driving detection tasks. However, we observe that the heterogeneous data distribution across drivers leads to significant performance degradation of the model learned in FL. To address this challenge, we propose a simple and effective federated bidirectional knowledge distillation framework, FedBiKD. Specifically, FedBiKD utilizes the knowledge from the global model in guiding local training to mitigate the issue of local deviation. Meanwhile, the consensus from the ensemble of local models is also employed to fine-tune the aggregated global model for less volatility in training. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of FedBiKD in distracted driving detection. The results show that FedBiKD significantly outperforms other FL algorithms in terms of accuracy, communication efficiency, convergence rate, and stability.},

  abstract     = {As the industry related to intelligent vehicles becomes increasingly mature, emerging in-vehicle applications and services are mushrooming. They have strict requirements on service response delay and network bandwidth. In the face of the dynamic environment in the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), how to design an adaptive edge caching strategy becomes a challenge. To cope with this challenge, some researchers have introduced optimization methods based on learning algorithms in cooperative caching. However, general learning algorithms tend to waste bandwidth and computing resources on repetitive task. To this end, we make full use of the idle resources in the road to build a cooperative caching system and propose a social-aware decentralized cooperative caching (SADC) for IoV. This strategy uses the federated learning framework to train the collaborative caching algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Among them, the road-side unit (RSU) is responsible for the training and updating of the global model, and vehicles use local data to provide local updates to the RSU, which then averages the updates provided by all vehicles to improve the shared model. In addition, we use the social network of vehicle users to obtain vehicle contact rates in different areas. The SADC strategy can reduce the content transmission latency and response time, thereby improving the experience quality of vehicle users. Compared with traditional caching strategies, this strategy reduces the average content access delay by about 20%. We also demonstrate the effectiveness of this strategy using an extensive set of experiments.},

Furthermore, with the aging of the world’s population, remote health monitoring and recommendations are becoming imperative to provide cost-effective healthcare solutions for improving the quality of life of our senior citizens. The explosive growth of wearable sensors (IoT sensors) and health bands has facilitated the interconnection among patients and caregivers to enable assisted living by leveraging AI techniques. This work proposes an end-to-end connected smart home healthcare system (FEEL) for elderly people. Our proposed framework addresses the main challenges of the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) system namely, the scarcity of labeled data and user’s diverse needs. The major contributions of the work are: 1) few-shot learning-enabled novel federated learning (FL) framework for health data and context information analysis and recommendation; 2) user and context-based knowledge graph (UKG) to represent and model health parameters and environmental impacts on recommendations; 3) deep learning architecture for activity monitoring and location estimation of the users; and 4) edge-fog-IoMT collaborative framework to collect, store, and share medical recommendations while protecting the privacy of the users. FEEL is specifically beneficial for elderly homes where several aged people stay together and require constant care. We aim to develop a novel AI module where along with the health parameters, the social context of the home can be augmented to provide an accurate and improved healthcare service. FEEL has been evaluated for three tasks, namely: 1) activity monitoring and location estimation; 2) fall detection; and 3) medical recommendations for unusual health conditions. A customized wearable device has been used to collect, store, and send health-related parameters. The experimental evaluation demonstrates promising accuracy (F1 score 0.86–0.94 range) for the tasks and outperforms the baselines by a significant margin ( $\approx 10$ %–16%).},

C-HealthIER is a cooperative health intelligent emergency response system that aims to reduce the time of receiving the first emergency treatment for passengers with abnormal health conditions. C-HealthIER continuously monitors passengers’ health and conducts cooperative behavior in response to health emergencies by vehicle-to-vehicle and vehicle-to-infrastructure information sharing to find the nearest treatment provider.

C-HealthIER also reduces the travel distance to the first emergency treatment place by 40.9% and thus reduces the travel time by 43.8% compared to receiving the treatment at the same hospital in the AutoPilot mode.},

A unified and integrated multidimensional DTs Network (DTN) architecture is constructed. On this basis, the propagation process model of malware in the network is built to analyze the malicious propagation behavior that threatens network security. This model ensures the protection of mobile distributed machine learning system security. Blockchain technology is a distributed data protection mechanism with broad prospects. It is characterized by decentralization, transparency, and anonymity, which can help ensure secure network data sharing and privacy protection. Based on this, this work designs a secure distributed data sharing (DDS) architecture based on blockchain to improve the security and reliability of data protection with the support of the Internet of Things (IoT). Then, digital resource allocation based on semi-distributed learning is examined to propose a broad learning federated continuous learning (BL-FCL) algorithm combining blockchain and DTs. This algorithm significantly speeds up the model training process. Broad learning technology supports incremental learning. In this way, each client does not need to retrain when learning the newly generated data. In the experimental part, the prediction accuracy of BL-FCL on the mixed national institute of standards and technology data set is similar to that of the FedAvg-50 and FedAvg-80 schemes. As the number of devices increases from 1 to 6, the detection probability exhibits a rapid decrease. However, as the number of devices further increases from 6 to 10, the detection probability gradually decreases at a slower rate until it reaches 0. Comparatively, the prediction accuracy of the BL-FCL outperforms the federated averaging algorithm-based scheme by 20%–60%. The BL-FCL reported here can deal with the problem of inaccurate training while ensuring the privacy and security of users. This work is of great significance for ensuring the security of the DTN and promoting the development of the digital economy. The results can provide references for applying blockchain and distributed learning in the DT field.},

However, the explosive growth in Internet of Things devices poses new challenges for smart devices to process the generated tremendous data with limited resources. In 6G networks, conventional mobile edge computing (MEC) systems encounter serious problems to satisfy the requirements of ubiquitous computing and intelligence, with extremely high mobility, resource limitation, and time variability. In this article, we propose the model of wireless computing power networks (WCPNs), by jointly unifying the computing resources from both end devices and MEC servers. Furthermore, we formulate the new problem of task transfer, to optimize the allocation of computation and communication resources in WCPN. The main objective of task transfer is to minimize the execution latency and energy consumption with respect to resource limitations and task requirements. To solve the formulated problem, we propose a multiagent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm to find the optimal task transfer and resource allocation strategies. The DRL agents collaborate with others to train a global strategy model through the proposed asynchronous federated aggregation scheme. Numerical results show that the proposed scheme can improve computation efficiency, speed up convergence rate, and enhance utility performance.},

In the real-world task-incremental scenario for biometrics, every edge device faces continuous task flows of private data without communication with others. security and performance are the primary concerns in identity authentication, and federated continual learning (FCL) is a promising solution. In this article, we design a personalized FCL framework to solve the problem of sequential identification in every distributed device. For each client, we create an adaptive continual metalearning model called continual task-distillation-based adaptive model-agnostic metalearning (cTD- $\alpha $ MAML), aiming to align the gradients of previous and new tasks and to make the learning-rate (LR) model learnable. For central aggregation, the server gathers the metainitialization from every local update and allocates the updated global metainitialization to clients. We propose an extension of federated average to locally reserve the learnable LR network to realize the personalization of clients. Results prove that in continual learning, our cTD- $\alpha $ MAML can learn to learn the seen tasks and avoid catastrophic forgetting. And in FCL, our personalized method realizes the knowledge transferring across clients, meanwhile improving the local performance and reducing the communication cost. In this way, the proposed personalized FCL framework can obtain a biometric template that is able to learn the expression space for new tasks with rapid adaption.},

However, for the conventional MCS, the large consumption of communication resources for raw data transmission and high requirements on data storage and computing capability hinder potential requestors with limited resources from using MCS. To facilitate the widespread application of MCS, we propose a novel MCS learning framework leveraging on blockchain technology and the new concept of edge intelligence based on federated learning (FL), which involves four major entities, including requestors, blockchain, edge servers, and mobile devices as workers. Even though there exist several studies on blockchain-based MCS and blockchain-based FL, they cannot solve the essential challenges of MCS with respect to accommodating resource-constrained requestors or deal with the privacy concerns brought by the involvement of requestors and workers in the learning process. To fill the gaps, four main procedures, i.e., task publication, data sensing and submission, learning to return final results, and payment settlement and allocation, are designed to address major challenges brought by both internal and external threats, such as malicious edge servers and dishonest requestors. Specifically, a mechanism design-based data submission rule is proposed to guarantee the data privacy of mobile devices being truthfully preserved at edge servers; consortium blockchain-based FL is elaborated to secure the distributed learning process; and a cooperation-enforcing control strategy is devised to elicit full payment from the requestor. Extensive simulations are carried out to evaluate the performance of our designed schemes.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have been widely used to perform search and tracking tasks in military and civil fields. To perform these tasks autonomously, a swarm of multiple UAVs need to be endowed with intelligence through machine learning (ML). However, the traditional centralized ML cannot be directly applied in UAV networks, since it is challenging to transmit raw data with limited bandwidth and energy budget. As a distributed manner, federated learning (FL) is more suitable for UAV networks than traditional ML schemes in order to boost edge intelligence for UAVs. Considering the limited energy supply of UAVs, we study how to minimize UAVs’ overall training energy consumption by jointly optimizing the local convergence threshold, local iterations, computation resource allocation, and bandwidth allocation, subject to the FL global accuracy guarantee and maximum training latency constraint. The formulated nonconvex mixed-integer programming problem is solved by a joint training and resource allocation optimization algorithm. In addition, we also study how to solve the problem considering fairness among different UAVs by changing the objective to minimizing the maximum energy consumption of UAVs, and extend the aforementioned approach to this problem. Our simulation results show that while satisfying both the training accuracy and latency constraints, the proposed algorithm can reduce more UAVs’ overall training energy consumption and the maximum energy consumption in the UAV swarm than four baseline schemes.},

Recently, to preserve the privacy of the data which are generated in the mobile ends, federated learning (FL)-based classification methods are being proposed. Unfortunately, the performance of FL-based methods can seriously degrade when the client data have skewness. This is particularly true for mobile network traffic classification where the environments in the mobile ends are highly heterogeneous. In this article, we first conduct a measurement study on traffic classification accuracy through FL using real-world network traffic trace and we observe serious accuracy degradation due to heterogeneous environments. We propose a novel federated analytics (FA) approach, FEAT, to improve the accuracy. Note that FL emphasizes on model training, yet our FA performs local analytic tasks that can estimate traffic data skewness and select appropriate clients for FL model training. Our analytics tasks are performed locally and in a federated manner; thus, we preserve privacy as well. Our approach has strong theoretical properties where we exploit Hoeffding inequality to infer traffic data skewness and we leverage the Thompson Sampling for client selection. We evaluate our approach through extensive experiments using real-world traffic data sets QUIC and ISCX. The extensive experiments demonstrate that FEAT can improve traffic classification accuracy in heterogeneous environments.},

  abstract     = {Energy forecasting is important because it enables infrastructure planning and power dispatching while reducing power outages and equipment failures. It is well-known that federated learning (FL) can be used to build a global energy predictor for smart grids without revealing the customers’ raw data to preserve privacy. However, it still reveals local models’ parameters during the training process, which may still leak customers’ data privacy. In addition, for the global model to converge, it requires multiple training rounds, which must be done in a communication-efficient way. Moreover, most existing works only focus on load forecasting while neglecting energy forecasting in net-metering systems. To address these limitations, in this article, we propose a privacy-preserving and communication-efficient FL-based energy predictor for net-metering systems. Based on a data set for real power consumption/generation readings, we first propose a multidata-source hybrid deep learning (DL)-based predictor to accurately predict future readings. Then, we repurpose an efficient inner-product functional encryption (IPFE) scheme for implementing secure data aggregation to preserve the customers’ privacy by encrypting their models’ parameters during the FL training. To address communication efficiency, we use a change and transmit (CAT) approach to update local model’s parameters, where only the parameters with sufficient changes are updated. Our extensive studies demonstrate that our approach accurately predicts future readings while providing privacy protection and high communication efficiency.},

  abstract     = {Benefiting from the powerful data analysis and prediction capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI), the data on the edge is often transferred to the cloud center for centralized training to obtain an accurate model. To resist the risk of privacy leakage due to frequent data transmission between the edge and the cloud, federated learning (FL) is engaged in the edge paradigm, uploading the model updated on the edge server (ES) to the central server for aggregation, instead of transferring data directly. However, the adversarial ES can infer the update of other ESs from the aggregated model and the update may still expose some characteristics of data of other ESs. Besides, there is a certain probability that the entire aggregation is disrupted by the adversarial ESs through uploading a malicious update. In this article, a privacy-preserving FL scheme with robust aggregation in edge computing is proposed, named FL-RAEC. First, the hybrid privacy-preserving mechanism is constructed to preserve the integrity and privacy of the data uploaded by the ESs. For the robust model aggregation, a phased aggregation strategy is proposed. Specifically, anomaly detection based on autoencoder is performed while some ESs are selected for anonymous trust verification at the beginning. In the next stage, via multiple rounds of random verification, the trust score of each ES is assessed to identify the malicious participants. Eventually, FL-RAEC is evaluated in detail, depicting that FL-RAEC has strong robustness and high accuracy under different attacks.},

Due to the high complexity of the formulated problem, we propose a situation-aware cluster and quantization level selection (SITUA-CQ) algorithm. In this algorithm, the FL server first assembles clients into clusters to mitigate the impact of biased data distributions and determines the most suitable clusters and quantization levels based on their computing power and channel quality. Extensive simulation results show that SITUA-CQ can reduce the round time by up to 80.3% compared to conventional algorithms.},

We then design a novel payment mechanism that is able to preserve individual rationality and incentive compatibility (truthfulness). At last, we design a UCB-based winner selection algorithm that is proven to achieve the server’s utility maximization with fairness and reciprocity. We have conducted extensive experiments on real data sets. The results demonstrate the superiority of FedAB, with a 10%–50% improvement in total reward, final accuracy, and convergence speed compared to state-of-the-art solutions.},

However, edge devices may have problems, such as unbalanced load and exit from the training process, which makes the training time of the model long and the effect is poor. Therefore, in the process of federated learning, the selection of reliable and high-quality edge devices becomes crucial. On this basis, in this article, we introduce reinforcement learning (RL) to preselect edge devices and obtain a set of candidate devices and then determine reliable edge devices through social attribute perception. The simulation experiment data analysis demonstrates that this scheme can improve the reliability of federated learning and complete the training process in a shorter time, the efficiency of federated learning increased by approximately 10.3%.},

  abstract     = {The unceasing development of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques is growing with privacy problems related to the training data. A relatively recent approach to partially cope with such concerns is Federated Learning (FL), a technique in which only the parameters of the trained neural network models are transferred rather than data. Despite the benefits that FL may provide, such an approach can lead to synchronization issues (especially when applied in the context of numerous IoT devices), the network and the server may turn into bottlenecks, and the load may become unsustainable for some nodes. To solve this issue and reduce the traffic on the network, in this paper, we propose P4FL, a novel FL architecture that uses the paradigm of network programmability to program P4 switches to compute intermediate aggregations. In particular, we defined a custom in-band protocol based on MPLS to carry the model parameters and adapted the P4 switch behavior to aggregate model gradients. We then evaluated P4FL in Mininet and verified that using network nodes for in-network model caching and gradient aggregating has two advantages: first, it alleviates the bottleneck effect of the central FL server; second, it further accelerates the entire training progress.},

Though FL enables a privacy-preserving mobile edge computing framework using IoT devices, recent studies have shown that this approach is susceptible to poisoning attacks from the side of remote clients. To address the poisoning attacks on FL, we provide a two-phase defense algorithm called ${\underline{Lo}cal\ \underline{Ma}licious\ Facto\underline{r}}$Lo̲calMa̲liciousFactor̲ (LoMar). In phase I, LoMar scores model updates from each remote client by measuring the relative distribution over their neighbors using a kernel density estimation method.

Comprehensive experiments on four real-world datasets have been conducted, and the experimental results show that our defense strategy can effectively protect the FL system. Specifically, the defense performance on Amazon dataset under a label-flipping attack indicates that, compared with FG+Krum, LoMar increases the target label testing accuracy from $96.0\%$96.0% to $98.8\%$98.8%, and the overall averaged testing accuracy from $90.1\%$90.1% to $97.0\%$97.0%.},

  abstract     = {Brain-inspired Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC) is an emerging framework in low-energy designs for solving classification tasks at the edge. Unlike mainstream neural networks (NNs) with high computational complexity, HDC offers a fast training strategy and an energy-efficient inference mechanism by computing data in the high-dimensional space with high parallelism. However, the original computing method of HDC results in weak accuracy due to its simplicity. Therefore, many works have proposed algorithmic innovations to improve the accuracy of HDC, while maintaining its efficiency with dedicated hardware architectures. Given this period of rapid evolution, this review paper presents a comprehensive study of recent developments improving the accuracy-efficiency trade-off of HDC, covering both algorithm and hardware-level approaches. Besides, as the amount of data generated by the Internet of the Things (IoT) devices keeps increasing, edge-cloud collaboration has become a key area of research. The emerging federated learning (FL) has become a key enabler in overcoming security and privacy issues by exchanging locally trained models for global aggregation. However, the energy constraint of edge devices hinders them from the real-time training of NN models. Alternatively, adopting HDC as a local model can be a potential solution to alleviating this issue since the computational requirements of HDC are affordable to most edge devices. In addition, HDC-based coding for wireless communication has been gaining traction due to its noise robustness. Therefore, this paper also covers recent works on HDC-based edge-cloud collaborative learning. Finally, we conclude this paper by highlighting the possible applications and future directions of HDC.},

  abstract     = {Recently, a considerable literature has grown up around the few-sample fault diagnosis task, in which few samples of fault data are available for model training. The lack of fault samples usually causes significant degradation of diagnosis performance, which is referred as few-sample problem. Many federated learning-based fault diagnosis methods are proposed as a popular strategy to solve this problem. However, the vast majority of these algorithms assume that few-sample categories of the local client are well-sampled in some clients. In this sense, they are unable to cope with faults that have rare or even no sample in all clients, namely, global unseen faults. To diagnosis global unseen fault categories, a federated zero-shot fault diagnosis framework is proposed in this article. First, we propose a general approach for building a semantic knowledge base, which provides auxiliary discriminant descriptions of different faults. Second, a bidirectional alignment network is designed using two coupled variational autoencoders, enabling the fusion of data and attributes and allowing attribute descriptions to assist in fault diagnosis tasks. Third, a cloud–edge collaboration model aggregation strategy is developed, which utilizes a generative replay mechanism and integrates the knowledge of each client, thus, enhancing the generalization and generation ability of the global model. Experiments conducted on the thermal power plant group illustrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed framework to categorize local and global unseen classes.},

In this paradigm, the training efficiency has long been challenged by the heterogeneity of communication conditions, computing capabilities, and available data sets at devices. Currently, researchers focus on solving this challenge via device selection from the perspective of optimizing energy consumption or convergence speed. However, the consideration of any one of them is insufficient to guarantee the long-term system efficiency and stability. To fill the gap, we propose an optimization problem to simultaneously minimize the total energy consumption of selected devices and maximize the convergence speed of the global model for device selection in FEL, under the constraints of training data amount and time consumption. For the accurate calculation of energy consumption, we deploy online bandit learning to estimate the CPU-cycle frequency availability of each device, based on an efficient algorithm, named fast-convergent energy-efficient device selection (FCE2DS), is proposed to solve the optimization problem with a low level of time complexity. Through a series of comparative experiments, we evaluate the performance of the proposed FCE2DS scheme, verifying its high training accuracy and energy efficiency.},

However, it consumes excessive learning time due to the existence of straggler devices. In this article, a novel topology-optimized FEEL (TOFEL) scheme is proposed to tackle the heterogeneity issue in federated learning and to improve the communication-and-computation efficiency. Specifically, a problem of jointly optimizing the aggregation topology and computing speed is formulated to minimize the weighted summation of energy consumption and latency. To solve the mixed-integer nonlinear problem, we propose a novel solution method of penalty-based successive convex approximation (SCA), which converges to a stationary point of the primal problem under mild conditions. To facilitate real-time decision making, an imitation-learning-based method is developed, where deep neural networks (DNNs) are trained offline to mimic the penalty-based method, and the trained imitation DNNs are deployed at the edge devices for online inference. Thereby, an efficient imitation-learning-based approach is seamlessly integrated into the TOFEL framework. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed TOFEL scheme accelerates the federated learning process and achieves a higher energy efficiency. Moreover, we apply the scheme to 3-D object detection with multivehicle point cloud data sets in the CARLA simulator. The results confirm the superior learning performance of the TOFEL scheme over conventional designs with the same resource and deadline constraints.},

Dark-NMF can detect malware activities by monitoring unused IP address space, i.e., the darknet.

Darknet sensors can observe multivariate time series of packets from the same hosts, represented as intersecting columns in different data matrices. Previous works do not consider intersecting columns, losing a host's semantics because they do not aggregate the host's time series. To solve these problems, we proposed a federated IoT malware detection NMF for intersecting source hosts (FINISH) algorithm for offloading computing tasks to 5G multiaccess edge computing (MEC). The experiments show that FINISH is scalable to a data size with a shorter computational time and has a lower false positive detection performance than Dark-NMF. The comparison results demonstrate that FINISH has better computation and communication efficiency than related works and a short communication time, taking only 1/10 the execution time in a simulated 5G MEC.

Their recommendation performance is greatly affected by the available analyzing data, but centralized massive data can cause data privacy issues. Hence, federated learning is applied to achieve a higher recommendation accuracy without sharing raw data. To improve the performance and reliability of traditional federated RSs, we propose HFSA, a semi-asynchronous hierarchical federated RS. First, from the architecture perspective, an edge server layer is involved between the central server and clients, which alleviates the server’s communication pressure and enhances the recommendation model training by configuring the global aggregation frequency. Besides, a semi-asynchronous aggregation mechanism is designed. It collects local parameters as much as possible within the predefined aggregation cycle and allows the slow clients to contribute their model parameters asynchronously. The tolerate round and dynamic participation time weights shield the heterogeneity and instability of edge clients and ensure the convergence of the global model. Compared with several classical baselines, the experimental results show that HFSA can achieve a relatively better recommendation performance with high accuracy and less training time. In addition, the influential factors of HFSA are evaluated as well.},

However, suitable input might not be available or may require extensive data collection.

Instead, this work considers knowledge sharing by first exchanging the weights of pretrained DNNs and then applying transfer learning (TL). Specifically, it addresses the economics of knowledge sharing in AI services by taking a market-based approach. In detail, a model based on Fisher’s market is devised for optimal knowledge sharing, defined as the gain in inference accuracy from exchanging DNN weights. The proposed approach is shown to reach a market equilibrium and to satisfy important economic properties, including Pareto optimality. A technique for weight fusion is also introduced to merge acquired knowledge with the existing one. Finally, an extensive evaluation is conducted in a distributed intelligence scenario. The obtained results show that the proposed solution is efficient and that weight fusion with TL significantly increases inference accuracy compared to the original DNN, without the overhead of federated learning.},

However, smart buildings use heterogeneous networks. The massive number of interconnected IoT devices increases the possibility of IoT attacks, emphasizing the necessity of secure and privacy-preserving solutions. Federated learning (FL) has recently emerged as a promising machine learning (ML) paradigm for IoT networks to address these concerns. In FL, multiple devices collaborate to learn a global model without sharing their raw data. However, FL still faces privacy and security concerns due to the transmission of sensitive data (i.e., model parameters) over insecure communication channels. These concerns can be addressed using fully homomorphic encryption (FHE), a powerful cryptographic technique that enables computations on encrypted data without requiring them to be decrypted first. In this study, we propose a secure FL approach in IoT-enabled smart cities that combines FHE and FL to provide secure data and maintain privacy in distributed environments. We present four different FL-based FHE approaches in which data are encrypted and transmitted over a secure medium. The proposed approaches achieved high accuracy, recall, precision, and F-scores, in addition to providing strong privacy and security safeguards. Furthermore, the proposed approaches effectively reduced communication overhead and latency compared to the baseline approach. These approaches yielded improvements ranging from 80.15% to 89.98% in minimizing communication overhead. Additionally, one of the approaches achieved a remarkable latency reduction of 70.38%. The implementation of these security models is nontrivial, and the code is publicly available at https://github.com/Artifitialleap-MBZUAI/Secure-Federated-Learning-with-Fully-Homomorphic-Encryption-for-IoT-Communications.},

Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm enabling many intelligent IoT applications; however, the transmitted model gradients or weights still encode private information, which can be exploited to launch inference attacks. One popular way is to apply local differential privacy (LDP) into FL. However, existing work does not provide a practical solution due to two issues. First, the fine-grained range difference of weights in different layers of an FL model has not been explicitly considered. Second, the accumulated privacy budget may cause a budget explosion. In this article, we propose a local differentially private scheme to train clustered FL models on heterogeneous IoT data by using adaptive clipping, weight compression, and parameter shuffling (namely, ACS-FL), aimed at mitigating the curse of dimensionality, the amount of LDP noise, and the communication overhead of IoT devices. Empirical evaluations on MNIST, fashion-MNIST, and Federated Extended MNIST demonstrate that ACS-FL achieves a superior performance in balancing the tradeoff between privacy and utility.},

  abstract     = {Model quantization has drawn much attention for federated learning (FL) over the Internet of Things (IoT) since it is an effective way to address the critical bottleneck of communication efficiency. State-of-the-art studies have generally assumed homogeneous model quantization, where all clients’ updates are quantized using the same number of bits and aggregated with the same weight at the server. However, in practical IoT scenarios, various IoT devices may apply heterogeneous quantization bits due to their different hardware capabilities, which leads to heterogeneous model quantization accuracy. This article addresses the problem of heterogeneous quantization bit allocation and aggregation for FL. The clients may be allocated with a different number of quantization bits, subject to a total quantization bit constraint. The server may employ different aggregation weights to each IoT device. In particular, we propose FedHBAA—FL with Heterogeneous Bit Allocation and Aggregation, a novel joint quantization bit allocation and server aggregation algorithm. In FedHBAA, we first develop an optimal server aggregation scheme under any given bit allocation among clients. By minimizing the drift term in the convergence rate analysis, a closed-form aggregation weight solution as a function of the allocated bits is obtained for both the strongly convex and nonconvex loss functions. Then, by solving the derived optimal aggregation weights, the optimal bit allocation scheme is obtained. Numerical experiments demonstrate that FedHBAA outperforms the traditional FedAVG algorithm with equal quantization bits.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is designed for training models using data distributed across multiple Internet of Things (IoT) devices or servers, reducing data transfer overhead and ensuring data security. However, the decentralization and diversity of IoT devices introduce statistical and system heterogeneity, which can lead to unstable model training and even system crashes. Although many studies attribute performance issues to client-drift caused by this heterogeneity, there is a lack of insight into how different forms of heterogeneity impact local model gradient variations and model convergence. In this article, we investigate model gradient distribution characteristics in heterogeneous training. We find that the challenge is not solely due to client-drift but is also closely linked to a high degree of model overfitting, which negatively affects local model training and equilibrium convergence. To address this challenge, we introduce an efficient framework called gradient optimization with FL (GOFL). First, GOFL incorporates the federated gradient normalization (FGN) technique to maintain gradient distribution consistency while mitigating client-drift stemming from heterogeneity. We also highlight the benefits of FGN in reducing local model overfitting and improving convergence. Second, GOFL introduces the federated device aggregation (FDA) strategy, a critical addition to FGN. It adaptively guides device selection and aggregation based on device contributions, ensuring a more balanced training approach in the face of system heterogeneity. The experimental results demonstrate that GOFL achieves state-of-the-art training accuracy while reducing the number of training rounds. In particular, it improves the accuracy of the classical FL framework FedAvg by 30.57% and reduces the number of convergence rounds by 5.17 times.},

To address the issues, we propose a privacy-preserving decentralized cross-institutional federated graph learning framework called DCI-PFGL for IoT service recommendation, which alleviates the negative impact of data heterogeneity while protecting data security. Our approach extracts graph feature embeddings using the shortest path graph kernel. These embeddings are then anonymized and compared on a blockchain through smart contracts, which helps match partner IoT institutions with lower data heterogeneity. Subsequently, IoT institutions within the same partition collaborate in federated graph learning. We also ensure the protection of transmitted information through differential privacy measures. Finally, we conduct comprehensive experiments on two benchmark data sets. Results demonstrate that DCI-PFGL outperforms other approaches in terms of system accuracy and collaboration costs.},

Nonetheless, the inherent non-IID characteristic of local data leads to poor convergence of a global model. Moreover, the global model fails to satisfy the personalized task demands of all clients. To address the above issues, this article studies client grouping and local model aggregation in FL from two perspectives: 1) measure of client data distribution and 2) distribution similarity among clients. To this end, a novel confidence-based similarity-aware personalized FL algorithm (FedCS) for personalized autonomous IoT is proposed by developing three key innovations, namely, a public average confidence (PAC) measure, a client grouping strategy with dynamic sampling (CGDS), and a sequential aggregated weight (SAW) strategy. Specifically, the PAC measure utilizes a public data set on the server side to estimate the client’s data distribution, which promotes a fair estimate of distribution similarity among clients while minimizing privacy risks. The CGDS strategy focuses on distribution similarity among clients and approximates the client grouping problem as an auxiliary task selection problem in multitask learning. This strategy assigns a client into multiple groups and enables the valuable information from each client to circulate among multiple groups. The SAW strategy further incentivizes more similar clients within a group to share greater knowledge and generates an adaptive aggregated weight for each client within a group. A thorough experiment on CIFAR10 and two healthcare benchmarks shows that FedCS achieves a superior performance.},

The vertical federated learning (VFL) framework, usually deployed by split learning, can analyze and integrate information on different features collected by different terminals in the IoT. The complete model is divided into a top model and multiple bottom models in a specific middle layer. Each passive party as a terminal with certain features owns a bottom model, and an active party as an edge server with labels holds the top model. Feature inference attack aims to infer the party’s features from the model predictions during prediction in VFL. Existing attacks considered the adversary an active party under the white-box or black-box model. However, an attacker usually is a passive party in practice because terminals are more vulnerable than edge servers. Therefore, this article discusses a practical feature inference attack in VFL during prediction in IoT under this setting. We design an adversary builds an inference model to minimize the distance between the predictions from the inferred features and target features. Because the information on the top model and other bottom models is unknown, the adversary cannot directly train the inference model. Therefore, we utilize the zeroth-order gradient estimation method to calculate the parameters’ gradients to train the inference model. Experimental results demonstrate that the performance of our attack is comparable to that of the white-box attacks while retaining apparent advantages over the existing black-box attacks.},

This article proposes a decentralized FL approach based on prototype representation learning (called DeProFL) and time-varying communication topology. The heterogeneity among devices can arise from varying data distributions and model architectures, leading to local or global gradient drift. To mitigate the effects of heterogeneity, we introduce prototype learning to establish consistent representations of samples and models across devices. Rather than directly propagating the large model weights, which require significant transmission volumes, we propagate prototype representations among local devices to reduce transmission. Given the limited communication resources of IoT and the dynamic wireless environments, we propose a time-varying decentralized FL approach to address these practical constraints. During each global iteration, every device shares its prototype only with adjacent devices for the collaborative learning, aiming to improve system stability and reduce network bandwidth usage. We have theoretically analyzed and verified the convergence of the DeProFL under nonconvex conditions. Extensive experiments have been applied to the benchmark data sets, and the results show that DeProFL outperforms state-of-the-art methods.},

However, recent research has highlighted an issue where model or gradient updates can be exploited to infer sensitive information from the training data, resulting in severe privacy leakage. Existing defenses against gradient leakage attacks often suffer from high computation overhead or compromised model performance. In addition, most defense methods lack sufficient protection for labels. To overcome the above shortcomings, we develop a compressed sensing (CS)-based practical and efficient privacy-preserving FL scheme. In order to provide simultaneous protection for both original data and labels, we propose a CS-based gradient perturbation method, which eliminates the information in the gradient that is commonly exploited by attackers to extract labels, and increases the discrepancy between the perturbed and original gradients. Meanwhile, double aggregation is adopted together to ensure individual gradients are not easily disclosed by attackers. We also design a novel gradient reconstruction method that adaptively estimates the true gradient sparsity used for decompressing, thereby improving the model performance in practical scenarios. Furthermore, our CS-based gradient compression reduces communication overhead and requires low computation overhead as it only involves fast matrix multiplication. Extensive experiment results demonstrate the strong privacy protection effects of our proposed scheme compared to other approaches across various settings, with advantages in terms of communication overhead, computation overhead, and model accuracy.},

In the open scenario of IoT, malicious devices can launch poisoning attacks to compromise the final model by submitting crafted gradients. Some previous studies defend against poisoning attacks by analyzing the statistical characteristics of plaintext gradients. However, plaintext gradients would expose private information to malicious FL devices or servers. To simultaneously resist poisoning attacks and preserve privacy, cryptography technology can be utilized to obfuscate the gradients in defense methods, but the private calculation of resisting poisoning attack methods will cause efficiency problems, especially imposing unaffordable overhead on resource-limited IoT devices. Therefore, resisting poisoning attacks efficiently while protecting privacy remains a challenge. This article proposes a secure and privacy-enhanced FL (SPEFL) framework for efficient privacy-preserving and poisoning-resistant FL in IoT. We design an efficient secure computation protocol based on a three-server architecture to facilitate the cryptographic computation of large linear and complex nonlinear operators in the method against poisoning attacks. In SPEFL, most of the calculations are efficiently performed on the servers, which will not impose too much burden on resource-limited IoT devices. In addition, we design a security-enhanced verifiable protocol to detect the malicious behavior of the server and guarantee the correctness of FL aggregation results. Experimental and theoretical results demonstrate that SPEFL can efficiently complete FL training meanwhile guaranteeing the accuracy of the model.},

  abstract     = {In contrast to methods relying on a centralized training, emerging Internet of Things (IoT) applications can employ federated learning (FL) to train a variety of models for performance improvement and improved privacy preservation. FL calls for the distributed training of local models at end-devices, which uses a lot of processing power (i.e., CPU cycles/sec). Most end-devices have computing power limitations, such as IoT temperature sensors. One solution for this problem is split FL. However, split FL has its problems, including a single point of failure, issues with fairness, and a poor convergence rate. We provide a novel framework, called hierarchical split FL (HSFL), to overcome these issues. On grouping, our HSFL framework is built. Partial models are constructed within each group at the devices, with the remaining work done at the edge servers. Each group then performs local aggregation at the edge following the computation of local models. End devices are given access to such an edge aggregated model so they can update their models. For each group, a unique edge aggregated HSFL model is produced by this procedure after a set number of rounds. Shared among edge servers, these edge aggregated HSFL models are then aggregated to produce a global model. Additionally, we propose an optimization problem that takes into account the relative local accuracy (RLA) of devices, transmission latency, transmission energy, and edge servers’ compute latency in order to reduce the cost of HSFL. The formulated problem is a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem and cannot be solved easily. To tackle this challenge, we perform decomposition of the formulated problem to yield subproblems. These subproblems are edge computing resource allocation problem and joint RLA minimization, wireless resource allocation, task offloading, and transmit power allocation subproblem. Due to the convex nature of edge computing, resource allocation is done so utilizing a convex optimizer, as opposed to a block successive upper-bound minimization (BSUM)-based approach for joint RLA minimization, resource allocation, job offloading, and transmit power allocation. Finally, we present the performance evaluation findings for the proposed HSFL scheme.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has been envisioned to enable many Internet of Things (IoT) devices to perform large-scale machine learning without sharing raw data, resulting in significant privacy improvements. In a wireless IoT system, FL helps clients to secure their confidential information and achieve improved learning performance. However, the conventional FL architecture is vulnerable to Byzantine workers, possessing the potential to send malicious updates that compromise the accuracy of the global model. Previous studies have proposed various secure aggregation rules and attacker detection techniques to address this issue. However, these techniques exhibit limited effectiveness and may lead to a decrease in accuracy. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Byzantine client detection algorithm called FedXPro by combining the predictive coding/biased competition-divisive input modulation (PC/BC-DIM) neural network and geometric median (GM). Predictive coding (PC) is the core of the PC/BC-DIM architecture, which can perform Bayesian inference by fusing priors and likelihoods to determine posterior distributions. The GM is employed to determine the prior knowledge of legitimate clients to execute the PC/BC-DIM algorithm. During training, the framework calculates the probability distribution for a set of valid clients chosen from the GM. In testing, it attempts to reconstruct the same distribution from other clients concerning prior knowledge, and ultimately, the reconstruction power is utilized to filter the malicious clients. Our extensive simulations demonstrate the superiority of our FedXPro approach over other state-of-the-art methods in terms of accuracy, a guaranteed faster convergence rate, and attack detection under different network settings.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative model training across massively distributed edge devices, such as Internet of Things (IoT) nodes. However, resource constraints impose a major challenge, as there exists a tradeoff between maximizing learning accuracy and minimizing communication overhead between the resource-limited devices. In this article, we present a device selection approach for heterogeneous FL systems based on multiobjective optimization (MOO) and knowledge transfer (KT). We formulate the resource constraint in federated optimization as a multiobjective problem, and obtain Pareto-optimal solutions balancing resource efficiency and test accuracy. Additionally, we introduce an innovative KT mechanism that propagates the globally optimal models obtained during MOO to subsequent FL tasks, further expediting convergence. The multiobjective formulation and KT provide new insights into efficient and robust FL for resource-constrained IoT applications. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world data sets. Results demonstrate that our method achieves up to 11% higher accuracy than state-of-the-art methods, while effectively mitigating resource constraints. Impact Statement—FL is an efficient algorithm that enables everything to be interconnected without sharing data. However, resource constraint is the main challenge for federated optimization problems. Although many works have proposed various solutions from different perspectives, these methods cannot simultaneously minimize the communication resource cost while ensuring algorithm performance. We propose an automatic device selection algorithm for federated systems based on MOO and KT. This work not only reduces the global resource usage rate of FL but also enables it to converge quickly.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) framework enables user devices to collaboratively train a global model based on their local data sets without privacy leak. However, the training performance of FL is degraded when the data distributions of different devices are incongruent. Fueled by this issue, we consider a clustered FL (CFL) method where the devices are divided into several clusters according to their data distributions and are trained simultaneously. Convergence analysis is conducted, which shows that the clustered model performance depends on cosine similarity, device number per cluster, and device participation probability. Besides, to quantify the training performance, the utility of clustered model training is defined based on the analysis results. Then, aiming at optimizing the system utility, a joint problem of resource allocation and device clustering is formulated, which is solved by decoupling it into two subproblems. First, given the results of device clustering, a low-complexity iterative algorithm based on the convex optimization theory is proposed to make the bandwidth allocation and the transmit power control. Then, according to the individual stability, a coalition formation algorithm is proposed for the device clustering. Finally, the real-data experiments on the classification tasks (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR-10, and CIFAR-100) validate the results of convergence analysis and advantages of the proposed algorithm in terms of the test accuracy.},

In the upcoming 6G era, with the rapid development of the Internet of Things (IoT), defending against malicious traffic has become even more challenging due to the diverse nature and widespread distribution of IoT devices. This paper presents a new distributed framework for detecting malicious traffic on the access side of the IoT. This framework shifts the line of defense forward, and could alleviate the resource-bottleneck problem of traditional detectors that are usually deployed at the victim side. In particular, we devise a transformer-based neural network, which is tailored for distributed malicious traffic detection at multiple detection points. Additionally, we develop a personalized federated learning-based collaborative algorithm to enable horizontal collaboration among multiple detection points by sharing neural network parameters. Different from the traditional federated learning framework which trains a high-precision global model, our proposed framework fully considers the differences in the distribution of IoT traffic at the entrance, and uses local traffic data to train personalized models with better local detection performance on the basis of the global model. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves an average detection accuracy of 99.2% and an F1-score of 99.2% for all detection points using the N-BaIoT dataset. In comparison to methods lacking collaboration, our approach exhibits significant improvements in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Moreover, our detection performance is comparable to that of centralized learning frameworks, despite sharing only the model parameters.},

However, the heterogeneity of various IIoT devices poses formidable challenges to FL-based intrusion detection, especially the training cost relating to delay and energy consumption. In this article, we propose a delay and energy-efficient asynchronous FL (AFL) framework for intrusion detection (DEAFL-ID) in heterogeneous IIoT. Specifically, we address the shortcomings of low efficiency and high energy consumption in existing FL-based solutions involving all idle IIoT devices. To do so, we formulate an AFL-based optimal device selection problem which aims to select high-quality training devices in advance by exploring the device advantages in detection accuracy, delay reduction, and energy saving. Subsequently, a deep Q-network (DQN)-based learning algorithm is developed to quickly solve the above high-dimensional problem. In addition, to further improve the detection performance, we build a hybrid sampling-assisted convolutional neural network (CNN)-based IDS model, which can eliminate the imbalance of IIoT data and enable the selected devices to fully extract data features. Through simulations, we demonstrate that DEAFL-ID achieves a significant improvement in training cost and detection performance compared with existing IDS schemes.},

To address the issue, we design federated learning with global–local knowledge fusion (FedKF) scheme in this article. The key idea in FedKF is to let the server return the global knowledge to be fused with the local knowledge in each training round so that the local model can be regularized toward the global optima. Therefore, the client model drift issue can be mitigated. In FedKF, we first propose the active–inactive model aggregation technique that supports a precise global knowledge representation. Then, we propose a data-free knowledge distillation (KD) approach to enable each client model to learn the global knowledge (embedded in the global model) while each client model can still learn the local knowledge (embedded in the local data set) simultaneously, thereby realizing the global–local knowledge fusion process. The theoretical analysis and intensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of FedKF over previous solutions.},

The central policy can be then used by the edges conducting the task, thereby mitigating the need for them to learn their own policy from scratch. Furthermore, this central policy can be collaboratively learned at the cloud server by aggregating local experiences from the edges, thanks to the hierarchical architecture of the IoT networks. To this end, we propose a novel collaborative policy learning framework for dynamic scheduling tasks using federated reinforcement learning. For effective learning, our framework adaptively selects the tasks for collaborative learning in each round, taking into account the need for fairness among tasks. In addition, as a key enabler of the framework, we propose an edge-agnostic policy structure that enables the aggregation of local policies from different edges. We then provide the convergence analysis of the framework. Through simulations, we demonstrate that our proposed framework significantly outperforms the approaches without collaborative policy learning. Notably, it accelerates the learning speed of the policies and allows newly arrived edges to adapt to their tasks more easily.},

As a machine learning approach for distributed architectures, federated learning generates a global model for edge devices by only transferring model parameters, and it ensures that the private data of each device is not leaked. This is naturally suitable for solving this problem. Because devices' data cannot be exchanged with other devices, one major challenge is learning an effective model among devices with heterogeneous data. Motivated by this issue, we propose hierarchical federated learning using a hypernetwork (HN) algorithm to alleviate the influence of non-IID data among the devices, including label distribution skew, quantity skew, and feature distribution skew. The lower layer of our method uses hypernetworks to generate the parameters of the local model for the devices, while its upper layer updates hypernetworks by aggregating their model parameters. It decouples the number of parameters transmitted by the upper and lower layers, and it achieves good accuracy while improving communication efficiency and reducing computation costs.},

However, there is a lack of weight quantization research for online federated learning using TinyML devices which are restricted by the mini-batch size, the neural network size, and the communication method due to their severe hardware resource constraints and power budgets. We name Tiny Online Federated Learning (TinyOFL) for online federated learning using TinyML devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). This paper performs a comprehensive analysis of the effects of weight quantization in TinyOFL in terms of accuracy, stability, overfitting, communication efficiency, energy consumption, and delivery time, and extracts practical guidelines on how to apply the weight quantization to TinyOFL. Our analysis is supported by a TinyOFL case study with three Arduino Portenta H7 boards running federated learning clients for a keyword spotting task. Our findings include that in TinyOFL, a more aggressive weight quantization can be allowed than in online learning without FL, without affecting the accuracy thanks to TinyOFL’s quasi-batch training property. For example, using 7-bit weights achieved the equivalent accuracy to 32-bit floating point weights, while saving communication bandwidth by  $4.6 \times $ . Overfitting by increasing network width rarely occurs in TinyOFL, but may occur if strong weight quantization is applied. The experiments also showed that there is a design space for TinyOFL applications by compensating for the accuracy loss due to weight quantization with an increase of the neural network size.},

To address these challenges, we construct a clustered FL Framework for IIoT intrusion detection (CFL-IDS) based on local models’ evaluation metrics (EMs). First, we designed an intrusion detection model with a dynamic focal loss (DFL) for all edge nodes (ENs). This model’s performance is enhanced under various imbalanced data partitions by dynamically altering the focus on samples during the loss minimization training process. Second, the time series of EMs of local models to reflect the data distribution of ENs implicitly, and use clustering algorithms to facilitate knowledge sharing among those ENs with similar data distribution to co-optimize a common model for them. Finally, an intelligent cooperative model aggregation mechanism (ICMAM) adaptively adjusts each local model’s weight distribution, which substantially improves the benefits of FL and alleviates subpar models’ alleviates interference from subpar models to FL. Experiments demonstrate that CFL-IDS has stronger robustness and displays superior performance under data imbalance and non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) situations while being effective against poisoning attacks.},

The prior defense mechanisms against FR attacks assumed that malicious clients (namely, adversaries) declare less than 50% of the total amount of clients. Moreover, they aimed for anonymous FR (AFR) attacks and lost effectiveness in resisting selfish FR (SFR) attacks.

Extensive experimental results validate that PASS: 1) has the same level as the state-of-the-art method in mean square error against privacy leakage; 2) defends against AFR and SFR attacks in terms of a higher defense success rate, lower false positive rate, and higher F1-score; and 3) is still effective where adversaries exceed 50%, with F1-score 89% against AFR attack and F1-score 87% against SFR attack. Note that PASS produces no negative effect on FL accuracy when there is no FR adversary.},

In such network, nodes are competing to share the bandwidth, in order to deliver their sensed data as fast as possible, to a central node (access point, cloud server, aggregator, etc.). With the lack of an optimal sharing policy, such competitive behavior however may affect directly networks’ quality of service and degrade their performance in terms of nodes’ throughput (sending rate), latency of the network, and nodes’ energy consumption. To overcome this, we propose a new noncooperative game-based scheme, called DeepGame, where each IoT device is acted as a player, asking for a high data throughput. DeepGame enables to adjust nodes’ throughput based on four main criteria: 1) nodes’ preferences concerning the data rate; 2) nodes’ priorities in the IoT network; 3) the quality of nodes data; and 4) nodes’ remaining energy. Moreover, a multiagent deep reinforcement learning model is built in federated way, on top of our game model in order to enable nodes (agents) learning the optimal action at each step of the game, and hence reaching the Nash equilibrium (NE) state. We use the Cooja emulator on top of Contiki OS to implement our game-based model. We evaluate and validate the DeepGame scheme on top of two different medium access techniques, carrier-sense multiple access with collision avoidance and time-division medium access (TDMA). Numerical results, with a good confidence interval, illustrate the efficiency of our scheme when leveraging the TDMA access technique in not only quickly converging to NE situation but also improving the performances of the IoT network including, nodes’ energy consumption, nodes’ throughput, and network overhead, when compared to other schemes.},

However, the adoption of AI-driven medical applications still faces tough challenges, including meeting security, privacy, and Quality-of-Service (QoS) standards. Recent developments in federated learning (FL) have made it possible to train complex machine-learned models in a distributed manner and have become an active research domain, particularly processing the medical data at the edge of the network in a decentralized way to preserve privacy and address security concerns. To this end, in this article, we explore the present and future of FL technology in medical applications where data sharing is a significant challenge. We delve into the current research trends and their outcomes, unraveling the complexities of designing reliable and scalable FL models. This article outlines the fundamental statistical issues in FL, tackles device-related problems, addresses security challenges, and navigates the complexity of privacy concerns, all while highlighting its transformative potential in the medical field. Our study primarily focuses on medical applications of FL, particularly in the context of global cancer diagnosis.

  abstract     = {Although deep neural networks (DNNs) have been remarkably successful in numerous areas, the performance of DNN is compromised in federated learning (FL) scenarios because of the large model size. A large model can induce huge communication overhead during the federated training, and also induce infeasible storage and computation burden at the clients during the inference. To address these issues, we investigate structured model compression in FL to construct sparse models with regular structure such that they require significantly less communication, storage and computation resources. We do this by proposing a three-layer hierarchical prior, which can promote a common regular sparse structure in the local models. We design a decentralized Turbo variational Bayesian inference (D-Turbo-VBI) algorithm to solve the resulting federated training problem. With the common regular sparse structure, both upstream and downstream communication overhead can be reduced, and the final model also has a regular sparse structure, which requires significantly less local storage and computation resources. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm can efficiently reduce the communication overhead during federated training and the resulting model can achieve a significantly lower sparsity rate and inference time compared to the baselines while maintaining a competitive accuracy.},

Federated learning (FL) can increase the participation of various data contributors, thus has great potential to develop a unified framework to shed light on the relationship between unseen domains and generalized domains. In this article, we proposed an FL-based unseen domain segmentation model. The architecture includes 1) an external memory module as an object feature guide to reduce the feature ambiguity of unseen domain objects; 2) a reattention activation mechanism for better completing localization of unseen domain objects, enhancing the features of potential targets and suppressing interference features; and 3) a self-supervised learning paradigm for achieving specific object feature exploration. Based on flexible splitting and combining, our model is able to capture both personalization and generalization capabilities, the client side retains a strong personalization ability, while the server side has a strong generalization ability. Moreover, taking into account the inherent limitations in computing and storage resources commonly associated with IoT devices, the introduced model leverages the concept of optional dependencies to enable efficient inference within resource-constrained client environments.

However, the heterogeneous distribution of data and resource-constrained end nodes in ubiquitous IoT systems present challenges for existing anomaly detection models. Due to the advantages of flexible deployment and multi-dimensional resources, high altitude platform stations (HAPSs) and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), which are important components of vertical heterogeneous networks (VHetNets), have significant potential for sensing, computing, storage, and communication applications in ubiquitous IoT systems. In this paper, we propose a novel VHetNet-enabled asynchronous federated learning (AFL) framework by adopting the compound-action actor-critic (CA2C) algorithm for UAV selection, which enables decentralized UAVs to collaboratively train a global anomaly detection model based on their local sensory data from IoT devices. In the VHetNet-enabled AFL framework, the UAV selection process aims to prevent UAVs with low local model quality and large energy consumption from affecting the learning efficiency and model accuracy. Due to the wide coverage as well as strong storage and computation capabilities, a HAPS operates as a central aerial server for aggregating local models of UAVs asynchronously and making decisions intelligently. Moreover, we propose a CA2C-based joint device association, UAV selection, and UAV placement algorithm to further enhance the overall federated execution efficiency and detection model accuracy under UAV energy constraints. Extensive experimental evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates that the proposed algorithm can achieve high detection accuracy with short federated execution time and low energy consumption.},

To train a model leveraging diverse healthcare IoT devices, we propose an advanced collaborative learning framework to fill the gap. With the proposed collaborative learning framework, individual IoT devices project their sensed features into a carefully developed latent space, which are transmitted to a central server. For privacy preservation, the latent local features are encoded within this space, while the samples’ labels remain securely stored in the individual IoT devices. Collaboratively, the deep neural network model is trained by both the central server and the diverse IoT devices. The central server handles the computationally intensive training processes, while the individual IoT devices evaluate the model’s performance and initiate back-propagation based on their locally stored labels. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed collaborative learning framework achieves performance similar to centralized training and significantly outperforms individual training while preserving data privacy.},

In the context of anomaly detection for Internet of Things (IoT) traffic, these alarms can be triggered by various factors, not all of which are malicious attacks. It is crucial to determine whether a malicious attack or benign operations cause an alarm. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative root cause analysis system called score-variational autoencoder (VAE), designed to complement existing IoT anomaly detection systems based on the federated learning (FL) framework. Score-VAE harnesses the full potential of the VAE network by integrating its training and testing schemes strategically. This integration enables Score-VAE to effectively utilize the generation and reconstruction capabilities of the VAE network. As a result, it exhibits excellent generalization, lifelong learning, collaboration, and privacy protection capabilities, all of which are essential for performing root cause analysis on IoT systems. We evaluate Score-VAE using real-world IoT trace data collected from various scenarios. The evaluation results demonstrate that Score-VAE accurately identifies the root causes behind alarms triggered by IoT anomaly detection systems. Furthermore, Score-VAE outperforms the baseline methods, providing superior performance in discovering root causes and delivering more accurate results.},

  abstract     = {In the midst of rising global population and environmental challenges, smart agriculture emerges as a vital solution by integrating advanced technologies to optimize agricultural practices. Through data-driven insights and automation, it tackles the necessity for sustainable resource management, enhancing productivity and resilience in the face of complex food security and ecological concerns. The prospects of utilizing the Internet of Things (IoT) for smart agriculture are tremendous, where many IoT devices can be deployed for local environment monitoring, precision farming, autonomous irrigation, and, soil management. In some use cases like smart monitoring and agrochemical applications, UAV-enabled mobile-edge computing (MEC) is proposed as an enabler to provide IoT nodes with additional resources by hosting their computation functions. From the implementation perspective, to flexibly manage the computation functions in UAVs and/or MEC server, the emerging network function virtualization (NFV) can be utilized. However, efficient orchestration of the virtualized functions would be a challenge. In this paper, we consider a decentralized UAV-aided MEC system for smart agricultural applications in which the processing nodes benefit from the NFV technology. We aim to propose a method for efficiently orchestrating the NFVs while some important metrics are minimized, i.e., the age of information (AoI) and total network energy consumption. Especially, we consider the case in which the network state is not fully observable to the orchestrator or the observations are exposed to uncertainties. Consequently, the problem is formulated as a decentralized partially observable Markov decision process (DEC-POMDP). As the formulated problem is NP-complete, we exploit some structural features of the proposed scheme to introduce the concept of symmetry and simplify the problem. Then, a novel decentralized federated learning-based solution is proposed to solve the problem. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed approach in minimizing the total network energy consumption and achieving  $AoI$  values less than  $200\:msec$  to support demanding real-time applications.},

For example, the nonindependently and identically distributed (non-IID) issue in FL prevents the convergence of global model. Moreover, FL lacks detection mechanism to resist poisoning attacks from malicious nodes, and it requires incentive mechanism to encourage nodes to share their resources. To address these challenges, this article proposes a secure and privacy-preserving FL system that leverages blockchain and edge computing technology. Specifically, a feature-contrastive loss function is constructed to train an unbiased global model under the non-IID condition. Additionally, a Byzantine-tolerance scoring mechanism is designed to resist poisoning attacks, and a reputation-based incentive algorithm is developed to estimate the rewards or penalties owed to nodes. The proposed method is applied to two case studies: 1) chiller fault diagnosis for heating, ventilation and air conditioning systems and 2) gearbox fault diagnosis for wind turbines in IIoT. Experimental results show the superior performance of the proposed method.},

The ensemble of machine learning algorithms such as Decision Tree, Lite Gradient Boost, Xtra Gradient Boost and Random Forest provide better values of accuracy (around 99%) with higher precision, re-call and F1-scores, thus proving their efficacy for intrusion detection in IoT networks.},

However, most existing DFL methods may ignore the communication resource constraints of the system. This may result in these methods unsuitable for many practical scenarios because the given resource constraints cannot be guaranteed. In this article, we propose a novel DFL, called DFL with adaptive compression ratio (AdapCom-DFL), that can adaptively adjust the compression ratio of transmission data to keep the communication latency within the constraint. Furthermore, we propose a communication network topology pruning approach to reduce communication overhead by pruning poor links with low data rates while ensuring the convergence. Additionally, a power allocation approach is presented to improve the performance by reallocating the power of communication links while complying with the communication energy constraint. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed AdapCom-DFL with network pruning and power allocation approach achieves better performance and requires less bandwidth under the given resource constraints compared with some existing approaches.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has attracted widespread attention in the Internet of Things domain recently. With FL, multiple distributed devices can cooperatively train a global model by transmitting model updates without disclosing the original data. However, the distributed nature of FL makes it vulnerable to data poisoning attacks. In practice, malicious clients can launch the label-flipping attack (LFA) by simply tampering with the labels of local data, thus causing the global model to misclassify the samples of a selected class as the target class. Although some defense mechanisms have been proposed, they rely on specific assumptions about data distribution, and their performance degrades significantly when the data on clients are non-IID. Besides, most existing methods require clients to upload model updates in plaintext so that the server can identify and remove the malicious updates. But, direct transmission of model updates may still reveal private information. Considering these issues, we develop a label-flipping-robust and privacy-preserving FL (LFR-PPFL) algorithm, which is applicable to both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID data. We first propose a detection method based on temporal analysis on cosine similarity to distinguish malicious clients from benign clients. Then, we propose a privacy-preserving computation protocol based on homomorphic encryption to implement this detection method and perform federated aggregation while protecting the privacy of clients. Besides, a detailed theoretical analysis is given to demonstrate the privacy guarantee of the proposed protocol. Experimental results on real-world data sets show that the proposed algorithm can effectively defend against LFAs under various data distributions.},

Also, existing open-source FL testbeds/frameworks have drawbacks that prohibit convenient deployment over a large spectrum of heterogeneous clients in realistic environments.

In this article, we introduce (RealFL) a novel, realistic, open-source, and extendable platform for FL that supports a large scale of heterogeneous clients. It enables a realistic assessment of FL solutions by controlling various environmental parameters, e.g., network, client churn, data distribution, training complexity, and client heterogeneity. Using these parameters, we assess RealFL performance through an extensive evaluation. Preliminary evaluation shows a performance gap of up to 72% in training time and 27% in accuracy between FL-simulated environments and RealFL. Moreover, extensive evaluation reveals that realistic environmental parameters could affect accuracy by up to 52.7%, training time by up to 77.5%, and communication overhead by up to 98%.},

A continuously differentiable approximated  $\ell _{1}$ -norm is also used as the sparse constraint to reduce the communication cost. Convergence analysis shows that sFedHP’s convergence rate is state-of-the-art with linear speedup and the sparse constraint only reduces the convergence rate to a small extent while significantly reducing the communication cost. Experimentally, we demonstrate the benefits of sFedHP compared with the federated averaging (FedAvg), hierarchical fedavg (HierFAVG), and personalized FL methods based on local customization, including FedAMP, FedProx, per- FedAvg, pFedMe, and pFedGP.},

But, in most cases, the medical institutions have incomplete medical data of the patients since a patient may consult different specialists (from various hospitals) during the treatment process. To overcome this problem, we build a smart and secure federated learning framework for intelligent health diagnosis with a blockchain-based incentive mechanism and nonfungible tokens (NFTs)-based marketplace. We make use of NFTs to develop clear demarkations on the ownership and accessibility of the data of patients. We create an NFT marketplace that manages access to the historical medical data of patients. A comprehensive incentive mechanism based on several factors, including the quality and relevance of the data, the frequency, regularity of data uploading, etc., is incorporated to encourage and penalize the patients based on their contributions to the global model. We used the Polyak-averaging technique for aggregating local models to form a global model. The extensive analysis shows that the proposed model achieves comparable performance with the centralized machine learning models while affording better security and access to better data. The results also show the efficacy of the proposed blockchain-based incentive mechanism.},

The federal learning (FL) framework-based modulation recognition (MR) is an essential component, but its use of uninterpretable deep learning (DL) introduces security risks. This article combines traditional signal interference methods and data poisoning in FL to propose a new adversarial attack approach. The poisoning attack in distributed frameworks manipulates the global model by controlling malicious users, which is not only covert but also highly impactful. The carefully designed pseudo-noise in MR is also extremely difficult to detect. The combination of these two techniques can generate a greater security threat. We have further advanced our proposal with the introduction of the new adversarial attack method called “chaotic poisoning attack” to reduce the recognition accuracy of the FL-based MR system. We establish effective attack conditions, and simulation results demonstrate that our method can cause a decrease of approximately 80% in the accuracy of the local model under weak perturbations and a decrease of around 20% in the accuracy of the global model. Compared to white-box attack methods, our method exhibits superior performance and transferability.},

However, scheduling more IIoT devices engaged in FL contributes to accelerated learning speed, but resulting in increased learning cost in terms of energy consumption and model accuracy reduction. In this article, we investigate the tradeoff between learning speed and cost in a three-layer FL-enabled IIoT system. Particularly, a weighted learning utility function is designed by capturing such a tradeoff. We aim to maximize the weighted learning utility in an FL training round by jointly optimizing the edge association as well as the allocations of resource block, computation capacity, and transmit power of the IIoT device. The resulting problem is a nonconvex and mixed-integer optimization problem, and consequently, it is difficult to solve. We thereby decompose the original problem into three subproblems, and then propose an overall alternating optimization algorithm to solve the subproblems iteratively until convergence. Via experimental results, it is demonstrated that the proposed scheme significantly improves the system-wide learning utility as compared to other baseline schemes. It is also shown that the proposed scheme can achieve the optimized tradeoff between learning speed and learning cost.},

To process data in real-time while protecting user privacy, federated learning (FL) has been regarded as an enabling technique to push edge intelligence into IoT networks with massive devices. However, FL latency increases dramatically due to the increase of the number of parameters in deep neural network and the limited computation and communication capabilities of IoT devices. To address this issue, we propose a semi-federated learning (SemiFL) paradigm in which network pruning and over-the-air computation are efficiently applied. To be specific, each small base station collects the raw data from its served sensors and trains its local pruned model. After that, the global aggregation of local gradients is achieved through over-the-air computation. We first analyze the performance of the proposed SemiFL by deriving its convergence upper bound. To reduce latency, a convergence-constrained SemiFL latency minimization problem is formulated. By decoupling the original problem into several sub-problems, iterative algorithms are designed to solve them efficiently. Finally, numerical simulations are conducted to verify the effectiveness of our proposed scheme in reducing latency and guaranteeing the identification accuracy.},

However, all state-of-the-art FD algorithms are designed for classification tasks only, and less attention has been given to regression tasks. To take advantage of this promising paradigm for localization which is inherently a regression problem, we introduce in this work an FD framework that is tailored to address regression learning problems. More specifically, we propose an FD-based indoor localization system that shows a good tradeoff in communication load versus accuracy compared to FL-based indoor localization. With our proposed framework, we reduce the number of transmitted bits by up to 98%. We analyze the energy efficiency regarding the number of communication rounds for both FD and FL systems to achieve the same localization accuracy. The results revealed that FD comes with greater energy efficiency by reasonably saving transmission energy at the expense of computation energy. This notably represents a significant advantage in the context of wireless sensor networks, particularly given the prevalence of battery-powered Internet of Things (IoT) devices operating with constrained bandwidth. Moreover, we show that the proposed framework is much more scalable than FL and, thus more likely to cope with the expansion of wireless networks.},

However, FL is susceptible to backdoor attacks due to its inherently distributed and privacy-preserving nature. Existing studies assume that backdoor triggers on different malicious clients are universal, and most defense algorithms are designed to counter backdoor attacks based on this assumption. Recently, dynamic backdoor attacks have been proposed to undermine robust algorithms in centralized machine learning. We introduce dynamic backdoor attacks into the FL system and develop three types of dynamic backdoors named Aggregation, Single, and Continuous to target the FL system. To defend against such attacks, we propose a novel robust algorithm called MITDBA, which utilizes gramian information to capture high-order representations, then employs spectral signatures to detect and remove malicious clients, and finally utilizes clipping operations to filter the selected local models during the aggregation process. We conduct attack and defense experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, and GTSRB data sets. The experimental results demonstrate that our designed attack strategies can successfully insert dynamic backdoors into the global model, bypassing the existing state-of-the-art defenses, but these attacks can be effectively mitigated by MITDBA.},

Addressing the two issues simultaneously is challenging, since the privacy-preserving mechanism tends to make the data be indistinguishable, whereas Byzantine-robustness methods require access for the data to make a comprehensive analysis. To solve this problem, in this article, we propose a novel defender for privacy-ensured Byzantine-robust FL on a compressive domain. Unlike existing works that mainly using computation-intensive techniques, our method leverages compressive sensing (CS) as a lightweight encryption to protect the data privacy, while maintaining the possibility of Byzantine-robustness analysis on the encrypted (compressive) model update (i.e., gradient). Our key insight is that the cosine similarity can be approximately measured on the compressive measurements of any two normalized vectors, thus makes it be feasible to identify the malicious gradients on the CS compressive domain. We theoretically prove the correctness of our method. Notably, due to the dimensionality reduction of CS, the computation and communication overhead of our system can be significantly reduced. This makes our scheme be fit for applying in the applications with resource-constrained devices, such as Internet of Things (IoT). Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our method.},

A key factor of FL is the model accuracy, which relies on the truth of the participating industrial edge device (IED)’s parameter. However, some untrusted IEDs can contaminate models by fabricating false FL parameters, thereby deceiving rewards, known as model poison attack (MPA). In this article, a truth-discovery-based multidimensional bidding (TD-MDB) strategy is proposed to obtain truthful parameters at a low cost for FL. In the TD-MDB strategy, parameter server (PS) will randomly assign the lightweight trust evaluation model to test the trust of each IED according to the accuracy of IED’s calculation. Then, in order to resist MPA and inference attack, we use an improved clustering algorithm to divide the trusted IEDs into different clusters based on their different trust and stability. Finally, a device selection strategy is proposed to select cost-effective IEDs for model training based on Asynchronous Advantage Actor–Critic (A3C) algorithm. In the TD-MDB strategy, the IEDs that provide more resources, high trust, and low bid will be selected to train the model and maximize the real revenue of the system with high accuracy. We finally carry out extensive evaluations, where results demonstrate that the TD-MDB strategy can effectively provide an efficient offloading strategy, resist MPA and ensure that truth computing for FL, which is better than the state-of-the-art strategies in model accuracy, system revenue, and other performance indicators.},

Hence, in recent years, scholars have devoted some attention to designing different resource allocation strategies. Among these strategies, reinforcement learning is considered to be one of the best methods for maximizing the efficiency of resource allocation schemes. In a typical reinforcement learning scheme, the edge hosts would be required to upload their local parameters to a central server. However, this process has privacy implications given some of the data processed by the edge hosts is likely to be highly sensitive. To tackle this privacy issue, we developed a concurrent joint reinforcement learning method based on local differential privacy. Our approach allows the edge host to add noise during local training to preserve privacy, and to make joint decisions with the central server to devise an optimal resource allocation strategy. Experiments show that this approach yields high performance while preserving the privacy of the edge hosts.},

Federated learning (FL) is being seen as an attractive framework to address the data privacy concerns of mobile users in the context of crowdsourcing. In FL on a crowdsourcing platform, constructing an effective deep neural network (DNN) is challenging. This is primarily because the quality of the global model depends on the local model quality, which can vary greatly due to differences in the computational resources, data quantity, and data quality provided by each worker. To address these challenges, we propose QARMA-FL: quality-aware robust model aggregation for FL in crowdsourcing applications, where we select the local model for aggregation based on its quality and performance. We also propose a model-quality-aware incentive mechanism to reward workers, based on their contribution to model training. Our model selection and incentive mechanism is capable of detecting free rider (FR) attacks, identifying workers who benefit from others’ contributions without contributing themselves. Most existing evaluations of FL in MC studies are not based on the real-world FL scenarios. Therefore, we evaluate QARMA-FL alongside a baseline FL model in a quantity-skew, non-identically distributed (IID) data setup where different workers contribute varying amounts of data for model training. Our diverse experiments validated QARMA-FL’s performance, demonstrating its ability to efficiently aggregate models in MC scenarios, reaching baseline results with a reduced worker participation by 40% to 60%.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is a collaborative machine learning paradigm where network-edge clients train a global model under the orchestration of a central server. Unlike traditional distributed learning, each participating client keeps its data locally, ensuring privacy protection by default. However, state-of-the-art FL implementations suffer from massive information exchange between clients and the server. This issue prevents the adoption in constrained environments, typical of the Internet of Things domain, where the communication bandwidth and the energy budget are severely limited. To achieve higher efficiency at scale, the future of FL calls for additional optimizations to reach high-quality learning capability with lower communication pressure. To address this challenge, we propose automatic layer freezing (ALF), an embedded mechanism that gradually drops a growing portion of the model out of the training and synchronization phases of the learning loop, reducing the volume of exchanged data with the central server. ALF monitors the evolution of model updates and identifies layers that have reached a stable representation, where further weight updates would have minimal impact on accuracy. By freezing these layers, ALF achieves substantial savings in communication bandwidth and energy consumption. The proposed implementation of the ALF mechanism is compatible with any FL strategy, requiring minimal effort and without interfering with existing optimizations. The extensive experiments conducted using a representative set of FL strategies applied to two image classification tasks show that ALF improves the communication efficiency of the baseline FL implementations, ensuring up to 83.91% of data volume savings with no or marginal losses of accuracy.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is an emerging paradigm to train model with distributed data from numerous Internet of Things (IoT) devices. It inherently assumes a uniform capacity among participants. However, due to different conditions such as differing energy budgets or executing parallel unrelated tasks, participants have diverse computational resources in practice. Participants with insufficient computation budgets must plan for the use of restricted computational resources appropriately; otherwise, they would be unable to complete the entire training procedure, resulting in model performance decline. To address this issue, we propose a strategy for estimating local models without computationally intensive iterations. Based on it, we propose computationally customized federated averaging (CC-FedAvg), which allows participants to determine whether to perform traditional local training or model estimation in each round based on their current computational budgets. Both theoretical analysis and exhaustive experiments indicate that CC-FedAvg has the same convergence rate and comparable performance as FedAvg without resource constraints. Furthermore, CC-FedAvg can be viewed as a computation-efficient version of FedAvg that retains model performance while considerably lowering computation overhead.},

In this article, we focus on studying efficient communication and computation scheme when constructing the Marine Internet of Things (M-IoT)’s digital twin with secrecy provisioning. Specifically, the digital twin model is trained based on federated learning, in which all the unmanned surface vehicles deliver the trained models with nonorthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to the high-altitude platform (HAP) for global model aggregation. Considering the potential eavesdropping on the radio signals of HAP, we utilize the chaotic sequences to spread the model information before the global model broadcasting. In this framework, we aim to minimize the total energy consumption for constructing the digital twin of M-IoT by jointly optimizing the global accuracy, the local accuracy, the HAP’s transmission power and NOMA transmission duration, subject to the secrecy provisioning and latency constraint. An effective low-complexity algorithm is proposed to tackle this joint optimization problem with the use of a layered feature. Finally, numerical results are given to validate the performance gain of the proposed scheme, in comparison with the fixed accuracy scheme, the nonspread spectrum scheme and the time division multiple access transmission scheme.},

  abstract     = {Crowd counting in smart surveillance systems plays a crucial role in Internet of Things (IoT) and smart cities, and can affect various aspects, such as public safety, crowd management, and urban planning. Using surveillance data to centrally train a crowd counting model raises significant privacy concerns. Traditional methods try to alleviate the concern by reducing the focus on individuals, but the concern still needs to be thoroughly resolved. In this work, we develop a horizontal federated learning (HFL) framework to train the crowd counting models which can preserve privacy simultaneously. This framework enables the smart surveillance system to learn from model aggregation without accessing the private data stored on local devices. Therefore, it eliminates the need for video data transmission, reduces communication costs, and avoids raw data leakage. Due to the lack of federated learning (FL) crowd counting data sets, we design four non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) partitioning strategies, including feature-skew, quantity-skew, scene-skew, and time-skew, to simulate real-world FL scenarios. In addition, we present an efficient fully convolutional network (e-FCN) for each client to demonstrate the practical applicability of the proposed framework. The e-FCN adopts an encoder-decoder architecture with fewer parameters, making it communication-friendly and easier to train. This design can achieve competitive performance compared to more complex models in surveillance crowd counting in literature. Finally, we evaluate the proposed HFL framework with e-FCN under our skew strategies on multiple real-world data sets, including crowd surveillance, ShanghaiTech PartB, WorldExpo’10, FDST, CityUHK-X, UCSD, and MALL. Extensive experiments allow us to present our developed Federated Crowd Counting benchmark as a reference for future research and provide guidance for FL algorithm selection in smart surveillance system deployment.},

Decentralized FL (DFL) overcomes the problems of untrusted aggregation server, single point of failure and poor scalability in traditional FL, making it suitable for industrial Internet of Things (IIoT). However, DFL provides more convenient conditions for malicious participants to launch attacks. This article focuses on the model poisoning attack in DFL for the first time, and proposes a novel attack method called collusive model poisoning attack (CMPA). To implement CMPA, we propose the dynamic adaptive construction mechanism, in which malicious participants can dynamically and adaptively construct malicious local models that meet distance constraints, reducing the convergence speed and accuracy of consensus models. Furthermore, we design the collusion-based attack enhancement strategies, where multiple participants can collude in the process of constructing malicious local models to improve the strength of attack. Empirical experiments conducted on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets reveal that CMPA significantly impacts the training process and results of DFL. Attack tests against representative defense methods show that CMPA not only invalidates statistical-based defenses but also skillfully overcomes performance-based methods, further proving its effectiveness and stealthiness. In addition, experiments based on practical IIoT scenario have also shown that CMPA can effectively disrupt system functionality.},

With the consideration of unique characteristics inherent in asynchronous FL, such as dynamic participating and multiminded IoT nodes such as mobile users (MUs), requirements of model training (i.e., training accuracy and convergence time), and limited uplink bandwidth, we formulate considered system as an online incentive mechanism design problem, where each MU is not only a buyer for communication resource but also a seller for computation service. To address the challenges involved in the design, we first derive the relationship between the number of participants and the global training accuracy in asynchronous FL. Then, based on that, we propose a novel mechanism, called the online incentive mechanism for asynchronous FL (OIMAF). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to design incentive mechanisms for asynchronous FL. Furthermore, in order to obtain a more robust mechanism, an improved online mechanism, called the two-shot-based online incentive mechanism (TOIM), is proposed by using OIMAF as a building block. Theoretical analyses show that our proposed online incentive mechanisms can guarantee individual rationality, truthfulness, a sound performance, and solution feasibilities. We further conduct comprehensive simulations to validate the effectiveness of our proposed mechanisms.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) allows the collaborative training of machine learning (ML) models between an aggregation server and different clients without sharing their private data. However, the FL archetype is mostly vulnerable to malicious model updates from various clients because of the privacy feature that makes the server see clients as a black box. When selecting clients, the server has no control on their contributions during training. This opacity of the server toward clients’ data associated with the huge amount of heterogeneous data brings a security risk and poses a deterioration of the model performance in FL. The impact of client selection and data heterogeneity on FL robustness has been overlooked. In this article, we develop an incentive design for heterogeneous client selection (IHCS) to improve the performance while reducing the security risks in FL. The IHCS approach applies a smarter client selection method using cooperative game theory and dynamic clustering of clients based on their heterogeneity level to overcome the challenges of lacking access to clients’ data, unbalanced data, and the lack of applicable data contribution from clients in FL. To do so, we attribute a recognition value to each client using the Shapley value. This recognition index is then used to aggregate the probability of participation level. We also implement, within the IHCS, a heterogeneity-based clustering (HIC) method that helps inhibit the negative influence of data heterogeneity and increase client contributions. Through extensive experiments with empirical results, the proposed approach outperforms the representative works on robustness of FL.},

However, the existing services are implemented in a centralized manner, which has potential and associated security and privacy risks also increased with Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. To better balance the quality of the services and ensure users’ privacy, a TP AMI service model based on differentially private federated learning (FL) is proposed in this article. Instead of sending the private energy data to the cloud server, the proposed service model trains the neural network models locally, and only model parameters are shared with the central server. Moreover, the identity of individuals is eliminated by adding random Gaussian noise during the secure aggregation. Furthermore, an attention-based bidirectional long short-term memory (ATT-BLSTM) neural network model is adopted to solve the long-range dependency problem of conventional neural networks. In the case study, a residential short-term load forecasting (STLF) task is implemented to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. Compared with other state-of-the-art energy service models, the proposed one can achieve similar accuracy as the typical centralized model and balances the trade-off between privacy loss and prediction accuracy flexibly.},

To overcome these challenges, we propose FDL: a federated distillation (FD) learning framework that combines FD and FL to fully utilize computation and network resources. We theoretically prove the convergence bound of the proposed FDL framework. Furthermore, to minimize the training time while maintaining inference accuracy, we design HAD: a heterogeneity-aware FL/FD selection algorithm that determines the total communication rounds and selects the set of FL and FD nodes in each communication round. The optimality of HAD is also theoretically proved. The FDL framework and HAD algorithm together minimize the training time while satisfying the inference accuracy in a heterogeneous and dynamic environment. Extensive experiments on various learning algorithms and data sets show that the proposed FDL-HAD solution can obtain the optimal selection decision in overwhelmingly less selection time compared with the Gurobi solver and can reduce the overall training time by at least 44.8% compared with FL solutions with the same inference accuracy.},

With the emergence of federated learning (FL) (also known as collaborative learning), multiple participants can create a common, robust, and secure machine learning model while addressing key issues in data sharing, such as privacy, security, accessibility, etc. Unfortunately, existing research shows that FL is not as secure as it claims, gradient leakage and the correctness of aggregation results are still key problems. Recently, some scholars try to address these security problems in FL by cryptography and verification techniques. However, there are some issues in this scheme that remain unsolved. First, some solutions cannot guarantee the correctness of the aggregation results. Second, existing state-of-the-art FL schemes have a costly computational and communication overhead. In this article, we propose SVFLC, a secure and verifiable FL scheme with chain aggregation to solve these problems. We first design a privacy-preserving method that can solve the problem of gradient leakage and defend against collusion attacks by semi-honest users. Then, we create a verifiable method based on a homomorphic hash function, which can ensure the correctness of the weighted aggregation results. Besides, the SVFLC can also track users who encounter calculation errors during the aggregation process. Additionally, the extensive experiment results on real-world data sets demonstrate that the SVFLC is efficient, compared with other solutions.},

To deal with the non-i.i.d. data issues and Byzantine attacks, a small amount of global data samples are introduced in CB-DSL and shared among IoT workers, which alleviates the local data heterogeneity effectively and enables to fully utilize the exploration-exploitation mechanism of swarm intelligence. Our convergence analysis theoretically demonstrates that the CB-DSL is superior to the standard FL with better convergence behavior. We also evaluate the model divergence of CB-DSL by deriving its upper bound, which measures the effectiveness of the introduction of the globally shared dataset.},

Unlike conventional centralized training in traditional ML, FL incorporates privacy and security measures as it does not share raw data between the client and server, thereby safeguarding potentially sensitive information. However, there are still vulnerabilities in the FL field, and commonly used approaches, such as encryption and blockchain technologies, often result in significant computational and communication costs, making them impractical for devices with restricted resources. To tackle this challenge, we present a privacy-preserving FL system specifically designed for resource-constrained devices, leveraging compressive sensing and differential privacy (DP) techniques. We implemented the weight-pruning-based compressive sensing method with an adaptive compression ratio based on resource availability. In addition, we employ DP to introduce noise to the gradient before sending it to a central server for aggregation, thereby protecting the gradient’s privacy. Evaluation results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves slightly better accuracy when compared to state-of-the-art methods like DP-federated averaging, DP-FedOpt, and adaptive Gaussian clipping-DP (AGC-DP) for the MNIST, Fashion-MNIST, and Human Activity Recognition data sets. Furthermore, our approach achieves this higher accuracy with a lower total communication cost and training time than the current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, we comprehensively evaluate our method’s resilience against poisoning attacks, revealing its better resistance than existing state-of-the-art approaches.},

To mitigate this problem, we propose three local cache update rules—first-in–first-out (FIFO), static ratio selective replacement (SRSR), and dynamic ratio selective replacement (DRSR)—that update the local cache of each client while considering the limited cache capacity. Furthermore, we derive a convergence bound for our proposed SFL algorithm as a function of the distribution discrepancy between the long-term data distribution and the client’s local training data set. We then evaluate our proposed algorithm on two data sets: 1) a network traffic classification data set and 2) an image classification data set. Our experimental results demonstrate that our proposed local cache update rules significantly reduce the distribution discrepancy and outperform the baseline methods.

  abstract     = {By leveraging smart devices [e.g., industrial Internet of Things (IIoT)] and real-time data analytics, organizations, such as production plants can benefit from increased productivity, reduced costs, enhanced self-monitoring, and autonomous decision-making. In such a setting, machine learning plays an important role in data analytics, but the use of conventional centralized machine learning solutions may raise uncomfortable concerns about data privacy. Hence, one can explore the use of federated learning. In this article, we propose privacy-preserving deep neural network training (PpNNT), which is designed to support federated learning in the multiparty setting. To minimize the overall costs, we further design a hybrid architecture to fully maximize resource utilization. Our proposed design allows the PpNNT system to provide high security, efficiency, and scalability for IIoT data analytics, as evidenced by our theoretical security proof and experimental results on the CIFAR10 dataset.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has been widely applied in Internet of Things (IoT). However, two security problems hinder the proliferation of FL in practical IoT, i.e., privacy leakage and poisoning attacks. To address these problems, various approaches have been proposed from different perspectives. Nevertheless, there remain two critical challenges: 1) how to establish a unified framework for protecting privacy and defending against poisoning attacks and 2) how to implement such methods in the flexible computing architecture of fog computing. In this article, we propose CROSSBEAM, a comprehensive scheme that provides both defense against poisoning attacks and privacy protection for FL in fog computing. Specifically, we construct frameworks to defend against poisoning attacks under both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID settings. Meanwhile, we establish an actively secure framework to protect users’ privacy, building a bridge between privacy protection and poisoning defense. Our CROSSBEAM allows multiple fog nodes and users to collaboratively achieve the FL training. Besides, it can effectively alleviate the negative impact caused by poisoning attacks, meanwhile, users’ data confidentiality can still be guaranteed, even if multiple active fog nodes collude with each other to infer users’ privacy. Additionally, our scheme is of robustness to participants (fog nodes and users) being off-line during the training process. Moreover, benefited from the superiorities of our hierarchical mechanism and secure framework, our scheme can perform with high efficiency. We present rigorous security proof and extensive performance analysis for our CROSSBEAM.},

  abstract     = {Unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted mobile edge computing (MEC) has largely extended the border and capacity of artificial intelligence of things (AIoT) by providing a key element for enabling flexible distributed data inputs, computing capacity, and high mobility. To enhance data privacy for AIoT applications, federated learning (FL) is becoming a potential solution to perform training tasks locally on distributed IoT devices. However, with the limited onboard resources and battery capacity of each UAV node, optimization is required to achieve a large-scale and high-precision FL scheme. In this work, an optimized multi-UAV-assisted FL framework is designed, where regular IoT devices are in charge of performing training tasks, and multiple UAVs are leveraged to execute local and global aggregation tasks. An online resource allocation (ORA) algorithm is proposed to minimize the training latency by jointly deciding the selection decisions of clients and a global aggregation server. By leveraging the Lyapunov optimization technique, virtual energy queues are studied to depict the energy deficit. With the help of the actor-critic learning framework, a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) scheme is designed to improve per-round training performance. A deep neural network (DNN)-based actor module is designed to derive client selection decisions, and a critic module is proposed through a conventional optimization method to evaluate the obtained selection decisions. Moreover, a greedy scheme is developed to find the optimal global aggregation server. Finally, extensive simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ORA algorithm can achieve optimal training latency and energy consumption under various system settings.},

In particular, in such a context, the underwater environment requires a special attention, since it is recognized as the most challenging domain, due to channel impairments and adverse propagation conditions. This article proposes a self-intelligent system able to efficiently perform underwater environment monitoring or underwater survey of critical infrastructure, by resorting to the use of the semantic communication paradigm to lower the impairments due to the underwater channel propagation conditions. In particular, in our case, images sent by underwater devices are collected by shore small base stations (SSBSs) to form their training data set to take part in a federated learning (FL) process with a ground base station. In particular, this article considers a semantic communication scheme based on a deep-convolution neural networks encoder–decoder architecture for an efficient exploitation of the data transmission from underwater devices to the linked SSBSs. Performance analysis is provided to show better behavior of the proposed system in comparison with the conventional alternative that does not involve the use of the semantic communication approach. Finally, a specific performance evaluation analysis is devoted to the investigation of the convergence behavior of the proposed FL procedure in reference to the cross ground–aqua system considered in order to highlight its advantages with respect to a classical implementation.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is a promising paradigm for collaboratively training networks on distributed clients while retaining data locally. Recent work has shown that personal data can be recovered even though clients only send gradients to the server. To against the gradient leakage issue, differential privacy (DP)-based solutions are proposed to protect data privacy by adding noise to the gradient before sending it to the server. However, the introduced noise affects the training efficiency of local clients, resulting in low model accuracy. Moreover, the identity privacy of clients has not been seriously considered in FL. In this article, we propose FL2DP, a privacy-preserving scheme focusing on protecting the data privacy as well as the identity privacy of clients. Different from the current schemes that add noise sampled from the Gaussian or Laplace distribution, in our scheme the noise is added to the gradient based on the exponential mechanism to achieve high training efficiency. Then, clients upload the perturbed gradients to a shuffler, which reassigns these gradients with different identities. We give a formal privacy definition called gradient indistinguishability to provide strict unlinkability for gradients shuffle. We propose a new gradient shuffling mechanism by adapting the DP-based exponential mechanism to satisfy gradient indistinguishability using the designed utility function. In this case, an attacker cannot infer the real identity of the client via the shuffled gradient. We conduct extensive experiments on two real-world datasets, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Satellite communications (Satcoms), whether ground-to-space or intersatellite, have, to date, primarily combined the two cutting-edge fields of communication and space, in which cybersecurity and space activities are intricately connected. The susceptibility of Satcoms and other space assets to cyberattacks, as a means of targeting critical infrastructure, is sometimes overlooked. Neither space nor cybersecurity policies, particularly for Satcoms systems, are equipped for the challenges posed by the convergence of space and cyberspace. With the rising number of cyberattacks, including reconnaissance, Denial-of-Service (DoS), and zero-day attacks, on Satcoms systems by extreme nation-state attackers, further defenses must be established. These defenses should enable the discovery of zero-day attacks whilst reducing false positives associated with the detection of advanced persistent threats. In this article, to address these cyber concerns, a comprehensive deep federated learning (DFL)-based threat detection model for proactively recognizing intrusions in Satcoms networks using decentralized on-device data while preserving the privacy of this data is proposed. Our approach leverages a decentralized data-level preprocessing (DLP) mechanism, ensuring that original data remains concealed while providing well-processed, statistically transformed thought-out data for robust threat detection. The proposed model executes federated learning rounds on a novel deep auto-encoder (DAE) architecture, maintaining local data on secure warehouses, and sharing only the learned weights with the central FL server. Also, its ensemble mechanism aggregates the updates from multiple sources to optimize the accuracy of the global learning model. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms the classic/centralised learning (non-FL) versions in terms of protecting the privacy of local data and providing an optimal accuracy rate for attack detection. Furthermore, using differential privacy (DP)-based DLP as a privacy preservation mechanism, the proposed model exhibits high levels of accuracy and better levels of privacy over the training data.},

FL enables AIoT devices to collaboratively train an ML model on the network edge, while protecting data privacy and solving the problem of isolated data islands. Contemporary FL is typically realized through the model aggregation of locally trained models and the model dissemination of a globally averaged model; such a procedure iteratively proceeds until a predefined convergence criterion is met. However, FL necessitates frequent information exchanges between AIoT devices and a parameter server, which inevitably induces tremendous communication costs. Therefore, this article proposes a new design for efficient one-shot FL for AIoT systems, so that the model aggregation and dissemination can be completed within a single communication round. To this end, we leverage optimal transport (OT) theory to design the coupled model averaging (CODE) algorithm to fuse the model weights of the neural networks (NNs) on AIoT devices. The CODE algorithm initially performs OT-based layer-by-layer model averaging (MA) over two NNs to form a fused NN, which will then be averaged with another NN. The CODE algorithm progressively determines a pair of NNs, and continues until all NNs have been examined to achieve one-shot FL. In addition, we provide a detailed convergence analysis for the proposed solution. Our simulation results show that the proposed solution outperforms other one-shot MA mechanisms under various parameter settings.},

In distributed systems, federated learning (FL) has gained widespread adoption due to its ability to train robust models while preserving privacy. However, most FL algorithms face challenges in handling heterogeneous data across different buildings, where distribution gaps exist. Moreover, addressing the heterogeneity in data necessitates additional efforts in model personalization, resulting in significant computational overhead, especially in large-scale FL settings. To address these challenges, we propose a sparse attentive aggregation-based federated AD (SAA-FAD) approach. SAA-FAD comprises an extraction network and a lightweight recognition network. The extraction network employs a variational Bayes scheme to extract statistical characteristics from the raw data for computing similarities between clients while preserving privacy. Then, the recognition network is trained with the extracted statistical features. The model is trained in an SAA manner, which leads to superior AD performance on heterogeneous data. Additionally, SAA-FAD achieves a time and memory complexity of  $\mathcal {O}(N\cdot {\mathrm {log}}N)$  for computing similarity. Simulation results demonstrate that SAA-FAD outperforms other baseline models, particularly in scenarios with heterogeneous data, while offering a significant advantage in terms of computation time.},

However, due to the heterogeneity of nodes and the existence of free-rider attacks, some device nodes may launch free-rider attacks to obtain the global model without any contribution, which not only dampens the enthusiasm of legitimate participants but also undermines the fairness of node contributions. In this article, we propose a free-rider attack detection (FRAD) mechanism for FL with deep autoencoding Gaussian mixture model (DAGMM) based on contribution and reputation. Specifically, we first model the contribution values based on the computing resource, communication cost, and data quality of each device node. Then, based on PageRank algorithms, we design an optimal reputation-based model to fairly and precisely choose benign nodes to participate in federated training under information asymmetry. Furthermore, we develop the FRAD mechanism via DAGMM that combines historical contribution with reputation scores.

Utilizing dispersive local data, industrial IoT devices distributively train a deep neural network (DNN) model, and the updated model parameters are aggregated at their associated field servers every round or at a centralized factory server every a few rounds. Aiming at optimizing the learning accuracy of FL without affecting the co-transmission of burst traffic (e.g., safety-critical traffic), an integrated TSN is considered to establish connections among the three layers, where a cyclic queuing and forwarding mechanism is deployed in each switch to support deterministic model parameter transmission with microsecond-level delay and near-zero packet loss requirements. To improve the FL performance, we formulate a multi-objective stochastic optimization problem to simultaneously maximize the scheduling success ratio and learning accuracy while satisfying the deterministic requirements of delay, jitter, and packet loss. Since the objective function is implicit and the available time slots of the considered TSN in each FL round are temporally correlated, the problem is difficult to solve in real time. Therefore, we transform the problem into a Markov decision process formulation and propose a dynamic resource scheduling algorithm, based on deep reinforcement learning, to make optimal resource scheduling decisions while adapting to device heterogeneity and network dynamics. Experimental results based on real-world dataset demonstrate that the proposed DetFed significantly accelerates FL convergence and improves learning accuracy as compared to state-of-the-art benchmarks.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) is a key solution for datadriven the Artificial Intelligence of Things (AIoT). Although much progress has been made, scalability remains a core challenge for real-world FL deployments. Existing solutions either suffer from accuracy loss or do not fully address the connectivity dynamicity of FL systems. In this article, we tackle the scalability issue with a novel, adaptive FL framework called FedSwarm, which improves system scalability for AIoT by deploying multiple collaborative edge servers. FedSwarm has two novel features: 1) adaptiveness on the number of local updates and 2) dynamicity of the synchronization between edge devices and edge servers. We formulate FedSwarm as a local update adaptation and perdevice dynamic server selection problem and prove FedSwarm‘s convergence bound. We further design a control mechanism consisting of a learning-based algorithm for collaboratively providing local update adaptation on the servers’ side and a bonus-based strategy for spurring dynamic per-device server selection on the devices’ side. Our extensive evaluation shows that FedSwarm significantly outperforms other studies with better scalability, lower energy consumption, and higher model accuracy.},

  abstract     = {With the proliferation of computationally powerful edge devices, edge computing has been widely adopted for wide-ranging computational tasks. Among these, edge artificial intelligence (AI) has become a new trend, allowing local devices to work cooperatively and build deep learning models. Federated learning is one of the representative frameworks in distributed machine learning paradigms. However, there are several major concerns with existing federated learning paradigms. Existing distributed frameworks rely on a central server to coordinate the computing process, where such a central node may raise security concerns. Federated learning also relies on several assumptions/requirements, e.g., the independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) data and model homogeneity. Since more and more edge devices are able to train lightweight models with local data, such models are normally heterogeneous. To tackle these challenges, in this article, we develop a blockchain-empowered federated learning framework that enables learning in a fully decentralized manner while taking the model heterogeneity and data heterogeneity into account. In particular, a federated learning framework with a heterogeneous calibration process, i.e., Model and Feature Calibration (FL-MFC), is developed to enable collaboration among heterogeneous models. We further design a two-level mining process using blockchain to enable the secure decentralized learning process. Experimental results show that our proposed system achieves effective learning performance under a fully heterogeneous environment.},

Although these models exhibit suitable performance, they are frequently constrained by privacy concerns. To attenuate this, a centralized learning strategy cannot be used in cases where there is a risk of data privacy breach, particularly in healthcare centers. Federated learning (FL) is a technique that allows for training a global model without sharing data by training distributed local models and aggregating them. By implementing FL throughout the training process, we can obtain a model with comparable generalization abilities to centralized learning while maintaining data privacy. This survey provides an introduction to the fundamental concepts and categories of FL, highlights the limitations of the centralized healthcare model, and discusses how FL can address these constraints. We also provide a detailed overview of the healthcare applications using FL models, along with commonly used evaluation metrics and public data sets. In this context, we have implemented a case study to demonstrate how FL can be applied in the healthcare field. Furthermore, we outline the key challenges and future trends in FL.},

However, as model size increases, the communication bandwidth required for deployment in wireless networks becomes a bottleneck. To address this, we propose a residual-based federated learning framework (ResFed) that transmits residuals instead of gradients or weights in networks. By predicting model updates at both clients and the server, residuals are calculated as the difference between updated and predicted models and contain more dense information than weights or gradients. We find that the residuals are less sensitive to an increasing compression ratio than other parameters, and hence use lossy compression techniques on residuals to improve communication efficiency for training in federated settings. With the same compression ratio, ResFed outperforms current methods (weight- or gradient-based federated learning) by over  $1.4\times $  on federated data sets, including MNIST, FashionMNIST, SVHN, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and FEMNIST, in client-to-server communication, and can also be applied to reduce communication costs for server-to-client communication.},

However, the amount of data needed to train models and the scenario privacy concerns limit the applicability of centralized ML/DL. Federated learning (FL) addresses these drawbacks but is vulnerable to adversarial participants and attacks. The literature has proposed countermeasures, but more effort is required to evaluate the performance of FL detecting SSDF attacks and their robustness against adversaries. Thus, the first contribution of this work is to create an FL-oriented dataset modeling the behavior of resource-constrained spectrum sensors affected by SSDF attacks. The second contribution is a pool of experiments analyzing the robustness of FL models according to i) three families of sensors, ii) eight SSDF attacks, iii) four FL scenarios dealing with anomaly detection and binary classification, iv) up to 33% of participants implementing data and model poisoning attacks, and v) four aggregation functions acting as anti-adversarial mechanisms. In conclusion, FL achieves promising performance when detecting SSDF attacks. Without anti-adversarial mechanisms, FL models are particularly vulnerable with $>$>16% of adversaries. Coordinate-wise-median is the best mitigation for anomaly detection, but binary classifiers are still affected with $>$>33% of adversaries.},

  abstract     = {As a new machine learning (ML) paradigm, federated learning (FL) empowers different participants to jointly train a more effective model than traditional ML. Unlike horizontal FL (HFL), which expands the sample space by aggregating local models, vertical FL (VFL) is suitable for scenarios where the sample ID between participants is the same but differs in sample characteristics. For a long time, VFL has been considered safe due to no data exchange and heterogeneity between parties. However, the recently proposed label inference attacks pose a significant security threat to VFL. Specifically, by adding randomly initialized layers to the top of local models, the passive label inference attack can infer tens of thousands of local participants’ private data with only 40 auxiliary labels. Since the attack is entirely local, using privacy protection technologies such as differential privacy cannot effectively defend against these attacks. Therefore, we propose a new privacy protection scheme called FL similar gradients (FLSGs) to defend against this attack. Unlike differential privacy, the FLSG scheme randomly generates gradients of a Gaussian distribution similar in dimension to the original gradients and calculates their cosine distance. If the distance is less than a certain threshold, the gradients are used instead of the original gradients to pass to the local participants. We conducted extensive evaluations on six real-world data sets, and the results show that FLSG provides a better defensive effect at lower computational overhead than other known methods when defending the passive label inference attack.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) has received considerable attention because it allows multiple devices to train models locally without revealing sensitive data. Well-trained local models are transmitted to a parameter server for further aggregation. The dependence on a trusted central server makes FL vulnerable to the single point of failure or attack. Blockchain is regarded as a state-of-the-art solution to decentralize the central server and provide attractive features simultaneously, such as immutability, traceability, and accountability. However, current popular blockchain systems cannot be combined with FL seamlessly. Since all local models should be collected before aggregation, the latency of FL is determined by the slowest device. The consensus process required by blockchain will increase the latency further, especially, when a large block is required for including the model. Moreover, forever-growing blockchain together with models will take up a lot of storage space, making it impractical to be deployed on lightweight devices. To address these problems, we propose a lightweight blockchain TORR for FL. A novel consensus protocol Proof of Reliability is designed to achieve fast consensus while mitigating the impact of stragglers. A storage protocol is designed based on erasure coding and periodic storage refreshing policy. With erasure coding, we take full advantage of the limited storage space of devices. With the periodic storage refreshing policy, we reduce the requirement for storage. Compared to the common blockchain-based FL system, TORR reduces the system latency, overall storage overhead, and peak storage overhead by up to 62%, 75.44%, and 51.77%, respectively.},

However, as existing DSA methods generally rely on centralized ML architectures, the scalability, privacy, and cost effectiveness of existing methods are limited. To address these issues, we propose a novel quantum-secured distributed intelligent system for smart cyber-physical DSA based on Federated learning (FL) and quantum key distribution (QKD), namely, quantum-secured federated DSA (QFDSA). QFDSA aggregates the knowledge learned from various local data owners (also known as clients) to predict and evaluate the system stability status in a decentralized fashion. In addition, in order to preserve the privacy of the distributed DSA data, QFDSA adopts the measurement-device-independent QKD, which can further improve the security of local DSA model transmission. Moreover, to accommodate the typical fast system environment and requirement changes, QFDSA alleviates the issues of limited key generation rates by utilizing secret-key pool that guarantee the availability of adequate secret-key materials. Extensive experiments based on the New England 10-machine 39-bus testing system and the synthetic Illinois 49-machine 200-bus testing system demonstrate that the proposed QFDSA method can achieve more advantageous DSA performance while protecting the privacy of local data for real-time DSA applications compared to the benchmarks. Besides, the secret-key generation rate can be improved to adjust its parameters dynamically in real time.},

It provides a platform for the development of novel Internet of Things (IoT) applications and services, particularly for the Internet of Vehicles (IoV), which encompasses all devices involved in intra-vehicle and inter-vehicle communications. However, this evolution towards a unified and huge cellular infrastructure creates new security challenges that require an intelligent attack detection framework to safeguard the network against cyber-security threats. This article proposes a hierarchical attack detection framework for 6G-enabled IoV. This framework relies on the processing capacities of edge nodes to satisfy the main 6G Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), such as trustworthiness, latency, connectivity, data rate and energy consumption. Federated Learning (FL) and non-cooperative gaming are used to train attack models and improve the detection process over time. The cooperative detection process based on FL is executed by security entities, IoV devices, edge servers and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) to improve the detection accuracy over time. To harden the security of the proposed attack detection framework, a robust Stackelberg security game is developed to identify malicious IoV devices and edge servers, and select suitable IoV devices and edge servers to participate in the training and attack detection processes. The identification and selection process mainly relies on computing a reputation score based on the activities of these IoV devices and edge servers. As compared to current security monitoring and detection solutions, our framework balances detection accuracy and reduced network overhead, specifically as the system scales up, i.e., when the malicious traffic is high. In addition, it mitigates threats from both external and internal adversaries.},

These nodes play a crucial role in facilitating the sharing of critical information towards various vehicles. However, a significant challenge that persists is the secure authentication of LoRa. Recently, radio frequency fingerprinting (RFF) emerges as a robust potential solution, offering both rapid and scalable identification capabilities. By harnessing machine learning (ML) techniques, the inherent hardware-level, unique, and resilient features of RFF can be thoroughly explored. Given the inherent non-identical (heterogeneity) of LoRa networks and the non-stationary characteristics of chirp signals, conventional approaches prove inadequate in effectively capturing the RFF features. To surmount these challenges, a novel scheme termed as “deep federated learning network (DFLNet)” is proposed. DFLNet facilitates distributed RFF learning while ensuring privacy preservation within diverse LoRa networks. Addressing the heterogeneity of datasets, we incorporate an adaptive optimizer that contributes to the efficient convergence improvement. The DFLNet adaptively manages computational demands and privacy concerns through the utilization of mobile edge computing (MEC) servers, thus enabling distributed learning. Empirical evaluations substantiate the efficacy of DFLNet, attaining an impressive identification accuracy of up to approximately 96.7% utilizing merely around 5000 samples per client, while concurrently ensuring a robust privacy preservation.},

In this article, a secure video offloading scheme based on multicell federated (MCF) deep reinforcement learning (DRL) is proposed to facilitate a secure, real-time, and efficient MEC network by efficient orchestration of limited resources.

To solve the formulated NP-hard problem, a MCF DRL algorithm based on the frameworks of multicell horizontal federated learning (FL) and hierarchical reward function-based twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) is proposed. First of all, hierarchical reward function-based TD3 is employed to solve the collaborative optimization NP-hard problem formulated for each single cell, where the optimal solution can be efficiently approached by the agent under the guidance of the innovatively designed hierarchical reward function. Then, multicell horizontal FL is applied on TD3 to obtain a model with higher model quality by averagely aggregating multiple individual TD3 models. Simulation results reveal that the proposed algorithm outperforms comparison algorithms in terms of utility, cost, latency, energy consumption, and security rate.},

  abstract     = {In Industry 4.0, artificial intelligence (AI) has been successfully applied in scenarios, such as fault prediction, traffic analysis, and production decision making. However, due to the sensitivity and security of data, privacy regulations prohibit the transfer and exchange of industrial data between entities, resulting in training data being fragmented into data silos that limit the accuracy of AI models. FL can effectively break the data silo effect, but naive federated learning (FL) (FedAvg) is vulnerable to inference attacks from aggregators and Byzantine attacks from participants. To address these issues, we propose a privacy-preserving and Byzantine-robust federated learning scheme (PBFL) for Industry 4.0. Under the setting of an benign-majority participants, PBFL can always identify benign direction and magnitude of updates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PBFL is more robust than state-of-the-art schemes, even with extreme proportion (49%) of malicious participants. Moreover, PBFL contains a series of well-optimized 2-party computation (2PC) protocols, causing it reduces total runtime of the unoptimized implementation by around  $3 \times \sim 4 \times $  and  $9 \times \sim 10 \times $  for 32-bit and 64-bit circuits, respectively.},

  abstract     = {The rapid increase in the number of connected vehicles on roads has made vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) an attractive target for malicious actors. As a result, VANETs require secure data transmission to maintain the network’s integrity. Federated learning (FL) has been proposed as a secure data-sharing method for VANETs, but it is limited in its ability to protect sensitive data. This article proposes integrating Blockchain technology into FL to provide an additional layer of security for VANETs. In particular, we propose a secure and efficient blockchain-based FL (SEBFL) approach to ensure communication efficiency and data privacy in VANETs. To this end, we use the FL model for VANETs, where computation tasks are decomposed from a base station to individual vehicles. This effectively reduces the congestion delay and communication overhead. Integrating blockchain with the FL model provides a reliable and secure data communication system between vehicles, roadside units, and a cloud server. Additionally, we use a homomorphic encryption system (HES) that effectively preserves the confidentiality and credibility of vehicles. Besides, the proposed SEBFL leverages the asynchronous FL model, minimizing the long delay while avoiding possible threats and attacks using HES. The experimental results show that the proposed SEBFL achieves 0.87% accuracy while a model inversion attack and 0.86% accuracy while a membership inference attack.},

We formulate a total latency minimization problem with probabilistic device selection, taking into account both the communication and computation latency in the whole FL procedure. However, it is highly challenging to optimally solve this problem due to the coupling issues of model convergence and latency minimization problem caused by the heterogeneity of local model updates. Through convergence analysis, we reveal that decoupling the resource allocation variables from the model convergence is essential to reduce the problem to a single-round latency minimization problem. To solve this simplified problem, we propose an alternating optimization scheme to jointly consider communication and computation resource allocation and mitigate the straggler effect. We prove that the resulting subproblems, i.e., bandwidth and computation capacity allocation, are both convex and can be optimally solved in closed form, respectively. Simulation results show that compared with the baseline scheme that allocates the communication and computation resources equally across edge devices, the proposed scheme can achieve up to 47.04% single-round latency reduction.},

The ability to utilize the collective power of mobile devices and human intelligence makes MCS a significant tool in various scenarios. Nevertheless, it faces practical challenge in protecting user privacy due to the sensitive nature of information collected by mobile devices. Additionally, the inherent openness of MSC and the heterogeneity of mobile devices raise reliability concerns among participants. To address these challenges, by integrating federated learning (FL) with the pairwise additive masking technique and the Chinese Remainder Theorem, we propose a blockchain-based privacy-preserving FL (BPFL) framework for MCS, which allows mobile participants to collaboratively solve a crowdsourced machine learning task while preserving privacy. Besides, it employs blockchain technology to record the training process in a transparent and tamper-proof ledger. This ledger guarantees the verifiability of aggregation results and the fair distribution of training rewards, thereby enhancing trust and fairness. We prove that our BPFL supports privacy protection and trust mechanism simultaneously and resists inference and collusion attacks. Experimental results show that our BPFL can achieve high performance in terms of computation cost, communication cost and model accuracy, which is friendly for mobile users with resource-constrained devices in MCS ecosystems.},

Homomorphic encryption is a vital technology for preserving user privacy in federated learning, and current studies are mainly concentrated on a single-key environment. However, if one user key is exposed in a single-key environment, it implies that the whole system key has been revealed. To strengthen security, we should allow different participants of federated learning to choose different keys to encrypt their local models. The cloud server should finish model aggregation calculation on ciphertexts under different public keys. Besides, research in this area is insufficient to guarantee mobile users’ data integrity verification and authentication in open channels. Therefore, this article proposes a privacy protection federated learning scheme VPFL based on the BCP cryptosystem, which can verify user identity and data integrity in a multikey environment. First, this scheme employs the BCP cryptosystem with double trapdoors for data encryption and transmission, enhancing the user’s privacy security. Second, a method for verifying user data integrity and identity was created utilizing bilinear aggregate signatures and verifiable secret sharing. It can effectively eliminate some incorrect data of some users. Third, VPFL tolerates users dropping out during training while still guaranteeing high accuracy. Finally, theoretical analysis and experimental evaluation indicate that the proposed scheme is efficient and secure.},

Its architecture makes detecting and defending against malicious model updates difficult. In addition, most recent studies to detect FL from malicious updates while maintaining the model's privacy have not been sufficiently explored. This article proposed blockchain-based federated learning with SMPC model verification against poisoning attacks for healthcare systems. First, we check the machine learning model from the FL participants through an encrypted inference process and remove the compromised model. Once the participants’ local models have been verified, the models are sent to the blockchain node to be securely aggregated.

  abstract     = {Mobile crowdsourcing federated learning (FL-MCS) allows a requester to outsource its model-training tasks to other workers who have the desired data as well as strong computing power. FL-MCS can thereby overcome the limitations of computing capability as well as the data availability of participants. However, FL-MCS still faces the problem of workers’ data privacy leakage when diverse malicious attacks (e.g., gradient inference attacks) are launched. To address these problems, some privacy-preserving FL-MCS (PPFL-MCS) schemes are proposed to aggregate local models at a central server. Unfortunately, these schemes are vulnerable to single-point-of-failure and other malicious attacks at the central server. Meanwhile, the workers may drop from the online task due to the erratic communication network in PPFL-MCS schemes, thereby resulting in the failure of the entire model aggregation. To solve these issues, we propose a novel dropout-tolerated and privacy-preserving decentralized FL-MCS scheme, namely, dropout-tolerated decentralized PPFL-MCS based on blockchain. Specifically, we define a novel cryptographic primitive, i.e., ID-based Aggregated Decryptable Broadcast Encryption (AD-IBBE) based on traditional ID-based broadcast encryption. In AD-IBBE, the senders’ ciphertexts can only be decrypted by themselves while the aggregated ciphertexts can be decrypted by all receivers in the broadcast group. Then, we design a homomorphic AD-IBBE algorithm, which is formally proved to be semantically secure. We next devise the decentralized PPFL-MCS scheme to guarantee the confidentiality of model gradients against internal and external adversaries. Moreover, we design a dropout-tolerated aggregation method to ensure the robustness of our decentralized PPFL-MCS scheme even if some workers lose connection. Extensive experimental results on different models and data sets demonstrate that the proposed scheme guarantees a close model accuracy to the nondropout case. Even when some workers are offline, our scheme still performs more efficiently than existing schemes in terms of dropout aggregation overhead.},

FL has the benefits of preserving data privacy and improving model accuracy. However, the occurrence of unexpected device exits during model training can severely impact the performance of the models. To address the communication overhead issue and accelerate model convergence, a novel adaptive FL with a negative inner product aggregation approach, namely, NIPAFed is proposed in this article. The NIPAFed leverages a congestion control algorithm inspired by TCP, known as additive multiplication subtraction strategy, to adaptively predict the workload of devices based on historical workload. So NIPAFed effectively mitigates the impact of stragglers on the training process. Additionally, to reduce communication overhead and latency, a negative inner product aggregation strategy is employed to accelerate model convergence and minimize the number of communication rounds required. The convergence of the model is also analyzed theoretically. The validity of NIPAFed is tested on federated public data sets and the NIPAFed is compared with some algorithms. The experimental results clearly demonstrate the superiority of the NIPAFed in terms of performance. By reducing device dropouts and minimizing the communication rounds, the NIPAFed effectively controls the communication overhead while the convergence is ensured.},

  abstract     = {Modern inertial measurement units (IMUs) with low cost, small size, and low power consumption are the key to improving indoor positioning accuracy. However, the performance of IMU in current mobile phones is spotty. The IMU positioning error of mainstream cell phones is basically greater than 1%, which makes it difficult for indoor fusion positioning technology to achieve accuracy within 3 m on a mobile phone, seriously restricting the development of the industry. Therefore, the existing indoor fusion algorithms need to introduce additional hardware, such as high-density UWB/Wi-Fi/Bluetooth deployment, to compensate for the lack of IMU performance, which significantly increases the deployment cost, difficulty, and reduces environmental applicability. It is found that deep learning can greatly improve the performance of IMU, but traditional deep learning methods have problems, such as privacy protection, difficulty in data collection, and low training efficiency. Therefore, we propose a novel data-driven inertial navigation method based on federated learning, named FedINS, to improve IMU performance and solve the above-mentioned problems. In order to further improve performance and reduce hardware cost, we introduce the concept of segment fusion. FedINS2 (2 means the second S, which is the segment) is formed by combining FedINS with low-cost edge-end ranging, which has terminal computing capabilities and edge-end ranging capabilities. FedINS2 not only greatly improves the performance of the smartphone IMU from 3.6% to 0.8%, but also has the characteristics of privacy protection and efficient data collection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed data-driven inertial navigation algorithm is effective.},

Privacy concerns have prompted the emergence of federated learning (FL) as a promising solution for AIoT intrusion detection. Despite their potential, FL-based IDSs still face challenges related to class-imbalanced data and Non-Independent and Identically Distributed (non-IID) data among AIoT devices. These challenges hinder FL from learning meaningful features from the data, thus impeding the convergence of the learning process. To tackle these issues, this article proposes a clustering-enabled federated meta-training (CFMT) framework for AIoT intrusion detection. The proposed CFMT framework effectively addresses the negative impact of imbalanced and non-IID data. Specifically, we design a data- and model-agnostic meta-sampler that adaptively balances local data sets, thereby mitigating the data imbalance problem. Additionally, we propose a dynamic clustering algorithm that selectively eliminates the local models affected by the training state bias caused by non-IID data, thereby addressing the non-IID data issue. Extensive case studies on two real-world data sets demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed CFMT framework compared to existing solutions, including federated non-IID algorithms and federated imbalanced learning algorithms, in terms of IDS performance.

Most of the previous machine learning-driven prediction approaches adopt traditional centralized training paradigm wherein mobile traffic data should be transferred to a central server. To exploit the distributed and parallel processing nature of MEC servers for training mobile traffic prediction models in a fast and secure manner, we propose a novel federated learning (FL) framework wherein locally trained prediction models over MEC servers are aggregated into a global model with joint optimization of MEC server selection and data set management for FL participation. From mathematical investigations of the influence of MEC server participation and data set utilization on the global model accuracy and training costs, including both training latency and energy consumption in the FL process, we first formulate an optimization problem for balancing the accuracy-cost tradeoff by considering a linear accuracy estimation model. Here, the optimization problem is designed using mixed-integer nonlinear programming, which is generally known as NP-hard. We then leverage a number of relaxation techniques to develop near-optimal yet the plausible algorithm based on linear programming. Furthermore, for practical concern, the proposed problem is extended by considering a concave accuracy estimation model; a genetic-based heuristic approach to the extension is proposed for determining the suboptimal solution. The numerical and simulation results suggest that our proposed framework can be effective for building mobile traffic prediction models in a more cost-efficient manner while maintaining competitive prediction accuracy.},

However, our experiments demonstrate that for clients with heterogeneous data and system capabilities, previous plain HE methods (i.e., encryption applied per gradient) and batch HE methods (i.e., encryption applied per batch of gradients) either significantly prolong training time or suffer from accuracy loss due to gradient quantization. We propose an adaptive batch HE framework for cross-device FL, which determines cost-efficient and sufficiently secure encryption strategies for clients with heterogeneous data and system capabilities. By leveraging the sparsity of convolutional neural networks for privacy-preserving similarity measurement of clients’ data, we first split the clients with similar data into their respective clusters. Then, we develop a fuzzy logic-based method to determine a cost-efficient and sufficiently secure HE key size for each client corresponding to its system capability, and arrange the clients with identical key size to the same groups. Finally, we design an efficient batch encryption approach for accuracy-lossless model aggregation. Extensive experiments on multiple heterogeneity scenarios demonstrate that our framework achieves comparable accuracy to plain HE, while reducing training time by  $3\times $ – $31\times $ , and communication cost by  $45\times $ – $66\times $ .},

  abstract     = {Jamming attacks are becoming increasingly common and pose a significant threat to the security and reliability of wireless sensor networks (WSNs). These attacks can be difficult to detect, as they often operate in a stealthy manner, disrupting communication between sensors. Artificial intelligence (AI) techniques have the potential to be highly effective in detecting jamming attacks. However, the adoption of AI-based techniques for detecting jamming attacks has been limited due to the scarcity of up-to-date and accurate data of these attacks. Privacy-aware collaboration among agents is expected to be essential in building robust AI-based models for detecting jamming attacks in WSNs. In this context, we propose a novel framework that uses collaborative federated learning (FL) to enable privacy-aware distributed learning among multiple agents without sharing their sensitive data. This can be particularly important in jamming attack detection, where data may contain sensitive information that should not be shared. In addition, we design a novel secure aggregation scheme to protect the FL aggregation service from reverse-engineering attacks. The effectiveness of our proposed framework was tested using the public Wireless Sensor Networks Dataset (WSN-DS) that includes four types of well-known jamming attacks (i.e., constant jamming, reactive jamming, random jamming, and deceptive jamming). The results of a thorough experiment using the WSN-DS data set demonstrate the effectiveness and high accuracy/F1-score (99%) in detecting jamming attacks while also maintaining participant privacy.},

Second, we design a novel scheduling algorithm for online collaborative resources by adopting multiple agents to learn and make decisions in accordance with the overall interests through federal learning. Finally, an experience replay mechanism for the internal experience pool is introduced to further improve learning efficiency.

  abstract     = {The widespread deployment of machine learning techniques in ubiquitous computing environments has sparked interests in exploiting the vast amount of data stored on mobile devices. To preserve data privacy, federated learning (FL) has been proposed to learn a shared model by performing distributed training locally on participating devices and aggregating the local models into a global one. Reinforcement learning (RL) can improve indoor localization by accounting for environmental dynamics, but has been trained on centralized data. An FL version of RL can help train a global localization model using data from different user clients whereas keeping data on device without centralization. We propose a personalized federated RL for indoor localization that addresses two major challenges. Due to the limited network connectivity of mobile devices, under the federated computing setting, it is impractical to aggregate updates from all clients in any learning iteration. Data gathered on different devices are heterogeneous, imposing difficulty in training high accuracy models. In our approach, each client performs RL to learn an action policy that can quickly search for a target based on its own data (e.g., personalized) and then a central server communicates with clients only for their model updates and learns a global model that is in the proximity of all client models (e.g., federated). Empirical evaluations demonstrate superior performance of the proposed approach in terms of localization accuracy and steadiness over existing methods. We further extend our approach to few-shot learning that can quickly position a new user with sparse annotated location data.},

Federated learning (FL) provides an emerging distributed paradigm that enables numerous users to collaboratively train deep-learning models while protecting user privacy and data security. However, many FL-related existing works only focus on improving communication bottlenecks due to frequent model parameter transmission, but ignore the performance degradation incurred by imbalanced user distribution and high inference latency due to the high complexity of deep-learning models in the emerging IoT-edge-cloud FL. In this paper, we propose an efficient user-distribution-aware hierarchical FL for communication-efficient training and fast inference in the IoT-edge-cloud DLaaS architecture. Specifically, we propose a user-distribution-aware hierarchical FL architecture to cope with the performance degradation owing to the imbalanced user distribution. The proposed architecture also features a lightweight deep neural network that adopts the designed lightweight fire modules as components and has a side branch for communication-efficient training and fast inference. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed schemes significantly boost the accuracy by up to 67.12%, save 47.98% communication costs, and accelerate inference by up to 87.24$\boldsymbol{\times}$× compared to benchmarking methods.},

At the same time, most of the existing studies about federated learning of heterogeneous models are limited to horizontal heterogeneity which share a highly homogeneous vertical structure. Little work has been done on vertical heterogeneity such as models with different number of functional layers or different connection methods within them, not to mention the integrated heterogeneity scenarios. In DraftFed, a novel draft-based approach is proposed to implement personalized federated learning for integrated heterogeneous models. Unlike traditional federated learning in which the parameters/gradients are exchanged, DraftFed uses drafts as key knowledge to guide mutual learning of models, which makes it suitable for model structure personalization application scenarios.},

To be specific, three deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) modules are deployed in parallel to make offloading decision on the execution mode of tasks and the proportion allocation of the transmission rate. Subsequently, a federated learning method is proposed to collaboratively train the HDDPG model by means of sharing models’ weights. Meanwhile, the delay and the energy consumption are comprehensively considered as the average system consumption, which is defined as a reward metric of FHDDPG. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposal. The experimental results indicate that the average system consumption of FHDDPG is cut down by 11.4% and 18% compare with HDDPG and DDPG, respectively, which means FHDDPG can achieve a better performance effectively.},

Fast sensing and accurate analysis of soil quality promote data-driven urban planning and management. Soil contamination hiders the sustainable development of the city’s environmental ecology. Decentralized sensing based on an Internet of Things (IoTs) architecture is a state-of-art technology. Portable spectral detection serves for immediate quantitative analysis of target components. In this case, portable sensing combined with federated learning simply shares the informative features extracted from the IoT-based spectral sensing data. However, the modeling technique for the analysis of spectroscopic sensing data faces several challenges due to the emerge of the big data problem in IoT-based sceneries. The consideration of possible federal learning of multinode collective data should ask for deep studies of modeling methodologies. In this article, we built up an IoT-based portable spectral sensing system for simultaneous sensing and detecting soil data at distributed sensing places. The collaborative training model was established for dealing with the dynamic sensing data, by the fusion design of a broad learning network (BLN) and a fuzzy partial least square (fPLS) model. The BLN output feature variables are produced from the scalable pseudo input layer with training linking weights adaptively, and the number of fuzzy rules is scalable. In the experiment, the decentralized sensing system and the fusion modeling framework carry out the model optimization for the portable near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopic sensing data of heavy metals in soil samples. The quantification of two elements demonstrated that the proposed framework yielded superior prediction results to the conventional PLS model for the training and evaluation of the dynamic sensing data. In interaction with the IoT architecture, the framework is prospectively expected as an advanced intelligent technical support for fast analysis of portable spectroscopic sensing data.},

However, gradient attacks (GAs) make a malicious client or parameter server of FL infer the local data of other clients only based on the model parameters exchanged. In FL frameworks and processes, it is important to understand the features that provide heuristic information for inferring raw data, as well as how best to defend against GAs. The academic community is currently investigating this problem. In this study, we demonstrate that the labels of input samples play a key role in the success of GAs. We analyze the rank of the coefficient matrix of the nonhomogeneous linear equation of gradients and input samples and propose an approach that performs special operations on the repetition and order of labels. The approach achieves a better defense effect against GAs without using a differential privacy (DP) framework. Our experimental results show that GAs fail (i.e., without leaking any valid information about local data) during the entire training process of a deep convolutional network in FL, and the accuracy of the network is less affected than that of DP.

For parameter aggregating in FL, over-the-air computation is a spectrum-efficient solution, which allows all mobile devices to transmit their parameter-mapped signals concurrently to a BS. Due to heterogeneous channel fading and noise, there exists difference between the BS’s received signal and its desired signal, measured as the mean-squared error (MSE). To minimize the MSE, we propose to jointly optimize the signal amplification factors at the BS and the mobile devices as well as the data size (the number of data samples involved in local training) at every mobile device. The formulated problem is difficult to address due to its nonconvexity. To find the optimal solution, we perform cost function simplification and variable transformation, and solve the transformed problem in a two-level structure. Optimal solution of the lower level problem is found by analyzing every candidate solution from the Karush–Kuhn–Tucker (KKT) condition. Optimal solution of the upper level problem is found by exploring its piecewise convexity. Numerical results show that our proposed method can greatly reduce the MSE and can help to enhance the training performance of FL compared with benchmark methods.},

To reduce communication resource consumption and training delay, acceleration training algorithms, especially momentum-based methods, are further developed for the training process. However, it is observed that under the influence of transmission noise, existing momentum methods exhibit poor training performance due to the noise accumulation along with the momentum term. This motivates us to propose a novel acceleration algorithm to achieve an efficient tradeoff between the training acceleration and noise smoothing. Specifically, to obtain clearer insights into the model update dynamics, we utilize a stochastic differential equation (SDE) model to mimic the discrete-time (DT) training trajectory. Through high-order drift approximation analysis on a general momentum-based SDE model, we propose a dynamic momentum weight and gradient stepsize design for the update rule, which is adaptive to both the training state and gradient quality. Such adaptation ensures that the training algorithm can seize good update opportunities and avoid noise explosion. The corresponding DT training algorithm is then derived via discretization of the proposed SDE model, which shows a superior training performance compared to state-of-the-art baselines.},

To address the problems of intense resource competition and privacy leakage in MEC, the federated learning for the TD3-based task offloading (FedTO) algorithm is proposed.

In order to solve these problems, we design a novel Cooperative Caching scheme by using Mobility Prediction and Consistent Hash for federated learning (called CMCF), which integrates mobility prediction and consistent hashing into the content caching scheme, and uses the federated learning framework to optimize the cached content, then we use the deep reinforcement learning algorithm to develop the optimal cooperative caching policy to reduce the average delay of content transmission. Extensive simulation results prove the superiority of our method. Compared with other advanced caching schemes, CMCF can increase the cache hit rate by 8.7% and reduce the average content delivery delay by 17.8%.},

  abstract     = {As the proliferation of sophisticated task models in 5G-empowered digital twin, it yields significant demands on fast and accurate model training over resource-limited wireless networks. It is vital to investigate how to accelerate the training process based on the salient features of practical systems, including heterogeneous data distributions and system resources both across devices and over time. To study the nontrivial coupling between participating device selection and their appropriate training parameters, we first characterize the dependency of convergence performance bound on system parameters, i.e., statistical structure of local data, mini-batch size, and gradient quantization level. Based on the theoretical analysis, a training efficiency optimization problem is formulated subject to heterogeneous communication and computation capabilities among devices. To realize online control of training parameters, we propose an adaptive batch-size-assisted device scheduling strategy, which prioritizes the selection of devices that offer good data utility and dynamically adjust their mini-batch sizes and gradient quantization levels adapting to network conditions. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed strategy can effectively speed up the training process as compared with benchmark algorithms.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning has recently been an emerging learning paradigm for training deep neural networks for activity recognition on resource-limited portable devices such as smartphones. However, prior most works typically focus on training a single global model while ignoring potential intrinsic relationship between clients, which cannot generalize well in heterogeneous federated human activity recognition (HAR) scenario. To address this issue, this article proposes an alternative via attention-based pairwise collaborations, where each client can collaborate with other similar clients to generate a stronger personalized model per client-specific objectives. Different from previous most works, instead of aggregating a single model, we adopt an attention method to calculate an optimal weighted model combination for each client, based on figuring out to what extent a client could benefit from other clients. Extensive experiments on four public HAR benchmark datasets with non-IID data setting show that our method significantly outperforms several popular state-of-the-art federated learning baselines in terms of overall accuracy while saves more than 50% communication overhead. Several ablation analyses are conducted to provide a deeper insight into the proposed algorithm in federated learning scenario. In particular, we analyze how the pairwise collaborations iteratively encourage similar clients to have stronger collaboration than inconsistent clients with heterogeneous activity data. An actual implementation is evaluated in a network of resource-limited Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices.},

  abstract     = {To exploit the massive amounts of onboard data in vehicular networks while protecting data privacy and security, federated learning (FL) is regarded as a promising technology to support enormous vehicular applications. Despite that FL has great potential to improve the architecture of intelligent vehicular networks, the mobility of the vehicles and the dynamic nature of wireless channels make the integration of FL and vehicular networks more challenging. In this paper, we propose a vehicle mobility- and channel dynamic-aware FL (MADCA-FL) scheme to fit vehicular networks and enhance learning performances. This novel scheme enables the RSU to select appropriate vehicles and weightedly average the local models. Afterward, MADCA-FL formulates a problem to maximize the model accuracy while assuring the latency and energy restrictions, by jointly optimizing the computation and communication resources. With a mixed-integer non-linear programming structure, the problem is NP-hard. First, we utilize the successive convex approximation algorithm to handle the non-convexity, and then apply the Lagrange multiplier method and the block coordinate descent method to obtain the optimal solution. Extensive experiments are conducted to confirm the effectiveness of our proposed scheme.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning-assisted edge intelligence enables privacy protection in modern intelligent services. However, not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) distribution among edge clients can impair the local model performance. The existing single prototype-based strategy represents a class by using the mean of the feature space. However, feature spaces are usually not clustered, and a single prototype may not represent a class well. Motivated by this, this article proposes a multiprototype federated contrastive learning approach (MP-FedCL) which demonstrates the effectiveness of using a multiprototype strategy over a single-prototype under non-IID settings, including both label and feature skewness. Specifically, a multiprototype computation strategy based on k-means is first proposed to capture different embedding representations for each class space, using multiple prototypes  $(k$  centroids) to represent a class in the embedding space. In each global round, the computed multiple prototypes and their respective model parameters are sent to the edge server for aggregation into a global prototype pool, which is then sent back to all clients to guide their local training. Finally, local training for each client minimizes their own supervised learning tasks and learns from shared prototypes in the global prototype pool through supervised contrastive learning, which encourages them to learn knowledge related to their own class from others and reduces the absorption of unrelated knowledge in each global iteration. Experimental results on MNIST, Digit-5, Office-10, and DomainNet show that our method outperforms multiple baselines, with an average test accuracy improvement of about 4.6% and 10.4% under feature and label non-IID distributions, respectively.},

  abstract     = {Federated learning (FL) enables collaborative training of a shared model on edge devices while maintaining data privacy. FL is effective when dealing with independent and identically distributed (IID) datasets, but struggles with non-iid datasets. Various personalized approaches have been proposed, but such approaches fail to handle underlying shifts in data distribution, such as data distribution skew commonly observed in real-world scenarios (e.g., driver behavior in smart transportation systems changing across time and location). Additionally, trust concerns among unacquainted devices and security concerns with the centralized aggregator pose additional challenges. To address these challenges, this paper presents a dynamically optimized personal deep learning scheme based on blockchain and federated learning. Specifically, the innovative smart contract implemented in the blockchain allows distributed edge devices to reach a consensus on the optimal weights of personalized models. Experimental evaluations using multiple models and real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed scheme achieves higher accuracy and faster convergence compared to traditional federated and personalized learning approaches.},

  abstract     = {Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) has emerged to overcome the shortcomings of conventional Federated Learning (FL) due to communication obstacles between the end users and the cloud server and the congestion at the backhaul of wireless network implementations. In this paper, we consider a wireless user-edge-cloud HFL network where the transmissions of the users’ local model parameters to the edge are multiplexed via the Non-Orthogonal Multiple Access (NOMA) technique. The joint problem of association and uplink transmission power allocation of the users to the edge is formulated and solved as a non-cooperative game in satisfaction form. Diverging from the prevailing research that proposes centralized solution concepts, each user makes autonomous decisions regarding its association and power level so as to attain a minimum acceptable tradeoff of three vital network factors. The latter includes the global model’s training accuracy and the users’ consumed energy and time during transmission. Different types of equilibria are explored, i.e., the Satisfaction Equilibrium (SE) and Minimum Efficient Satisfaction Equilibrium (MESE) which not only fulfills users’ minimum tradeoff but also minimizes the overall network’s cost. Algorithms based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) and Best Response Dynamics (BRD) are, then, devised to conclude the SE and MESE points. The proposed framework is evaluated via modeling and simulation, verifying its efficiency in achieving an equitable balance in the network.},

Medical data is sensitive and highly regulated and anonymization is often insufficient to protect a patient’s identity. Traditional clustering algorithms are also unsuitable for longitudinal behavioral health trials, which often have missing data and observe individual behaviors over varying time periods. In this work, we develop a new decentralized federated multiple imputation-based fuzzy clustering algorithm for complex longitudinal behavioral trial data collected from multisite randomized controlled trials over different time periods. Federated learning (FL) preserves privacy by aggregating model parameters instead of data. Unlike previous FL methods, this proposed algorithm requires only two rounds of communication and handles clients with varying numbers of time points for incomplete longitudinal data. The model is evaluated on both empirical longitudinal dietary health data and simulated clusters with different numbers of clients, effect sizes, correlations, and sample sizes. The proposed algorithm converges rapidly and achieves desirable performance on multiple clustering metrics. This new method allows for targeted treatments for various patient groups while preserving their data privacy and enables the potential for broader applications in the Internet of Medical Things.},

  abstract     = {Data privacy is becoming increasingly important as data becomes more valuable, as evidenced by the enactment of right-to-be-forgotten laws and regulations. However, in a federated learning (FL) system, simply deleting data from the database when a user requests data revocation is not sufficient, as the training data is already implicitly contained in the parameter distribution of the models trained with it. Furthermore, the global model in the FL system is vulnerable to data poisoning attacks by malicious nodes. Exploring a reliable data poisoning reversal method can effectively counter such attacks. In this article, we analyze the necessity of decoupling the processes of unlearning and training and propose a training-agnostic and efficient method that can effectively perform two types of unlearning tasks: 1) client revocation and 2) category removal. Specifically, we decompose the unlearning process into two steps: 1) knowledge erasure and 2) memory guidance. We first propose a novel knowledge erasure strategy called momentum degradation (MoDe) which realizes the erasure of implicit knowledge in the model and ensures that the model can move smoothly to the early state of the retrained model. To mitigate the performance degradation caused by the first step, the memory guidance strategy implements guided fine-tuning of the model on different data points, which can effectively restore the discriminability of the model on the remaining data points. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing task-specific algorithms and matches the performance of retraining, accelerating the execution time by 5–20 times compared to retraining on different data sets.},
