  abstract={The machine learning performance usually could be improved by training with massive data. However, requesters can only select a subset of devices with limited training data to execute federated learning (FL) tasks as a result of their limited budgets in today’s IoT scenario. To resolve this pressing issue, we devise a blockchain-enhanced FL market (BFL) to  $(i)$  make data in computationally bounded devices available for training with social Internet of things,  $(ii)$  maximize the amount of training data with given budgets for an FL task, and  $(iii)$  decentralize the FL market with blockchain. To achieve these goals, we firstly propose a trust-enhanced collaborative learning strategy (TCL) and a quality-oriented task allocation algorithm (QTA), where TCL enables training data sharing among trusted devices with social Internet of things, and QTA allocates suitable devices to execute FL tasks while maximizing the training quality with fixed budgets. Then, we devise an encrypted model training scheme (EMT) based on a simple but countervailable differential privacy methodology to prevent attacks from malicious devices. In addition, we also propose a contribution-driven delegated proof of stake (DPoS) consensus mechanism to guarantee the fairness of reward distribution in the block generation process. Finally, extensive evaluations are conducted to verify the proposed BFL could improve the total utility of requesters and average accuracy of FL models significantly.},

  abstract={The recent growth of Complex Networks (CN) has produced significant advancements in the study of the integration of these networks into the Internet of Things (IoT) environment. As a result, innovative approaches to representing, describing, and analyzing dynamic social relationships and interactions among a variety of objects have been developed. By offering a shared conceptual framework with the IoT scope, CNs can address the most significant IoT difficulties. To achieve this, the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm is presented. It is essential in the process of forming social relationships between IoT-deployed things. Any SIoT device can use its social links to access the desired service. The SIoT recommendation-based link selection strategies are examined in this survey using the Systematic Literature Review (SLR) approach. To group the research into areas where recommendation-based friendship selection is important, we provide a cutting-edge technological taxonomy. A thorough comparison of studies based on applied techniques is also given, as well as a synopsis of the major contributions of the evaluated publications. Finally, we describe new emerging challenges that are now being faced, as well as prospective research areas and unresolved problems.},

  abstract={With the advances in Social Internet of Things (SIoT) and Federated learning (FL), smart devices are now able to cooperatively and locally perform learning tasks to protect sensitive data by Differential Privacy (DP). On the other hand, Hierarchical FL (HFL) clusters SIoTs into multiple local training groups to reduce communication overheads by local aggregation. In this paper, we explore SIoT Training Group Construction (STGC) for HFL to minimize the total SIoT computation, communication and hiring costs, and the privacy cost for exploiting DP. We prove that STGC is NP-hard and inapproximable within any factor unless P = NP. Then, we design an algorithm with the ideas of Coverage Efficiency Indicator, Data Balance-aware Dual Adjustment, and Privacy-Aware Rerouting to choose and cluster SIoTs and to determine the aggregator for local training and SIoT routing in each cluster. Simulation results manifest that the proposed algorithm outperforms state-of-the-arts regarding the total cost, model accuracy, and convergence time.},

  abstract={The Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is revolutionizing how we interact with our everyday lives. By adding the social dimension to connecting devices, the SIoT has the potential to drastically change the way we interact with smart devices. This connected infrastructure allows for unprecedented levels of convenience, automation, and access to information, allowing us to do more with less effort. However, this revolutionary new technology also brings an eager need for service recommendation systems. As the SIoT grows in scope and complexity, it becomes increasingly important for businesses and individuals, and SIoT objects alike to have reliable sources for products, services, and information that are tailored to their specific needs. Few works have been proposed to provide service recommendations for SIoT environments. However, these efforts have been confined to only focusing on modeling user-item interactions using contextual information, devices’ SIoT relationships, and correlation social groups but these schemes do not account for latent semantic item–item structures underlying the sparse multimodal contents in SIoT environment. In this article, we propose a latent-based SIoT recommendation system that learns item–item structures and aggregates multiple modalities to obtain latent item graphs which are then used in graph convolutions to inject high-order affinities into item representations. Experiments showed that the proposed recommendation system outperformed state-of-theart SIoT recommendation methods and validated its efficacy at mining latent relationships from multimodal features.},

  abstract={Graph neural networks (GNNs) are a powerful tool to predict the categories of IoT nodes for providing diverse high-quality services in the social Internet of Things (SIoT). Intuitively, SIoT could be divided into several communities based on similar interests and mutual trust, whereas interaction between cross-community nodes may intrigue data privacy. With the popularity of federated learning (FL), a global GNN model can be collaboratively trained by exploiting knowledge from multiple parties in a privacy-preserving way. However, since node attributes across different SIoT communities are usually multi-source and heterogeneous, the performance of an optimum global model may exhibit potential bias against minority social groups, i.e, unfairness, thereby undermining the efficiency of node classification and social behavior analysis. To address this problem, we propose PFedNC, a proportional fairness-aware federated learning framework for node classification in SIoT system. Specifically, we incorporate proportional fairness and related Nash bargaining solution into FL optimization objective, which imposes more fairness while maintaining a similar average performance. Moreover, we design a class-balanced re-weighting loss function to mitigate imbalanced class distribution caused by non-IID node distribution. Extensive experiments on two node-level SIoT simulation datasets demonstrate that our PFedNC framework effectively encourages performance fairness among social groups and achieves a favorable tradeoff between fairness and efficiency.},

  abstract={The Social Internet of Vehicles (SIoV) is constructed so that the vehicle, as an entity, generates social awareness, which leads to the social behavior of the vehicle. The SIoV has multidimensional, heterogeneous, massive, real-time dynamic data, so its data security is a major concern. The structure of the SIoV and the characteristics of security primitives are studied in this review, which defines the social community by the vehicle. After this, the attack model is elaborated on, further refining the source, target, and capabilities of the attack. On this basis, typical data security solutions are compared and analyzed. In this survey, the focus is on the collaborative application of federated learning in SIoV data security protection. Ultimately, the current challenges and possible future research directions in this field are discussed.},

  pages={2143-2150},
  abstract={Anomaly detection aims to identify data or behav-iors that are different from the usual patterns. In traditional anomaly detection settings, edge devices collect the data and send it to a centralized server for model training, which faces two critical issues: (1) it risks data exposure during transmission; (2) it demands a large amount of network bandwidth for data transfer. To tackle these problems, we propose a Visual Federated Learning algorithm (VFLA) for anomalous behavior identification in the multi-UAVs system. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to merge federated learning with video-based anomaly detection. VFLA consists of two phases: The initial phase is training a pseudo-label generator. UAVs collect a dataset and manually annotate it. This labeled data is then used to train the pseudo-label generator on the server, which is subsequently distributed back to the UAVs. The second phase is the federated learning-based anomaly detection model training. UAVs leverage the pseudo-label generator to automatically annotate the collected video footage. These annotated videos are fed into an anomaly detection network for training. Once the local training is completed, UAVs upload their local models to a server for federated aggregation. The global model is then redistributed to the UAVs for additional training rounds, until reach the target accuracy. Finally, we simulate the federated learning anomaly detection algorithm on the Shanghai-tech dataset, it demonstrates an average accuracy boost of 5.6% compared to baselines.},

  abstract={As 5G and mobile computing are growing rapidly, deep learning services in the Social Computing and Social Internet of Things (IoT) have enriched our lives over the past few years. Mobile devices and IoT devices with computing capabilities can join social computing anytime and anywhere. Federated learning allows for the full use of decentralized training devices without the need for raw data, providing convenience in breaking data silos further and delivering more precise services. However, the various attacks illustrate that the current training process of federal learning is still threatened by disclosures at both the data and content levels. In this paper, we propose a new hybrid privacy-preserving method for federal learning to meet the challenges above. First, we employ an advanced function encryption algorithm that not only protects the characteristics of the data uploaded by each client, but also protects the weight of each participant in the weighted summation procedure. By designing local Bayesian differential privacy, the noise mechanism can effectively improve the adaptability of different distributed data sets. In addition, we also use Sparse Differential Gradient to improve the transmission and storage efficiency in federal learning training. Experiments show that when we use the sparse differential gradient to improve the transmission efficiency, the accuracy of the model is only dropped by 3% at most.},

  abstract={Federated Learning (FL) builds on a mobile network of participating nodes that train local models and contribute to the learning model parameters at a central server without being obliged to share their raw data. The server aggregates the uploaded model parameters to generate a global model. Common practice for the uploaded local models is an evenly weighted aggregation, assuming that each node of the network contributes to advancing the global model equally. Due to the heterogeneous nature of the devices and collected data, it is inevitable to have variations between the contributions of the users to the global model. Therefore, users (i.e., devices) with higher contributions should be weighted higher during aggregation. With this in mind, this paper proposes a reputation-enabled aggregation methodology that scales the aggregation weights of users by their reputation scores. Reputation score of a user is computed according to the performance metrics of their trained local models during each training round, therefore it can be a metric to evaluate the direct contributions of their trained local model. Numerical comparison of the proposed aggregation methodology to a baseline that utilizes standard averaging as well as a second baseline that is scoped to a reputation-based client selection shows an improvement of 17.175% over the standard baseline for not independent and identically distributed (non-IID) scenarios for an FL network of 100 participants. Consistent improvements over the first and second baselines under smaller FL networks with users ranging from 20 to 100 are also shown.},

  abstract={Decentralized learning (DL) allows IoT devices to exchange local model updates with only their neighboring devices instead of sending their model updates to a central server for aggregation. However, current DL frameworks cannot support the emerging Social IoT(SIoT) paradigm since SIoT devices exchange model updates with only social neighbors based on specific social relations (e.g., ownership and parental relationships). Conversely, sharing model updates with non-social neighbors can improve training performance but may violate social relations. Differential privacy (DP) is thus engaged with DL to ensure data security, while excessive devices engaging DP may downgrade the training performance. However, most research neglects the effect of neighbor selection for each device based on social networks, physical networks, and DP. Therefore, in this paper, we explore the non-trivial relation among the above factors to present a DL framework, DeepPrivacy, and prove its convergence rate and DP. Then, we formulate a novel optimization problem, CoTOPO, to find an efficient communication topology 1 for model updates exchange among devices in DL, and propose an algorithm, AutoTag, for CoTOPO. Last, experiment results manifest that DeepPrivacy and AutoTag combined outperform the state of the art in terms of convergence rate and physical training time significantly on CIFAR10 and FMNIST.},

  abstract={In the contemporary landscape of vehicular communications, the role of vehicular ad-hoc networks (VANETs) has become increasingly pivotal, transcending the capabilities of traditional mobile ad-hoc networks (MANETs). These advancements in VANETs play a critical role in enhancing traffic management systems, promoting collision prevention, bolstering road safety, and efficiently handling emergency scenarios. Modern vehicles, equipped with advanced data collection tools, accumulate extensive information encompassing vehicle health, fuel requirements, and comprehensive location histories. This rich data repository is instrumental in forecasting future destinations and facilitating timely arrangements, embodying the essence of ambient intelligence within the Internet of Things (IoT) framework. In emergency contexts, the rapid analysis of vehicle data is crucial for identifying the nearest emergency facilities. This paper proposes an innovative approach that leverages machine learning and edge computing techniques to predict vehicles' subsequent locations using large-scale data, concurrently prioritizing user privacy. We employ federated learning for processing at the network's edge and integrate a blockchain-based distributed database to ensure robust data privacy and security. The application of blockchain and federated learning in training models on expansive datasets is particularly effective in estimating the proximity to medical facilities and emergency services. Furthermore, this study introduces an optimization method to monitor vehicle speed and outlines a comprehensive attack model, along with effective protection measures.},

  abstract={At present, the centralized learning models, used for IoT applications generating large amount of data, face several challenges such as bandwidth scarcity, more energy consumption, increased uses of computing resources, poor connectivity, high computational complexity, reduced privacy, and large latency towards data transfer. In order to address the aforementioned challenges, Blockchain-Enabled Federated Learning Networks (BFLNs) emerged recently, which deal with trained model parameters only, rather than raw data. BFLNs provide enhanced security along with improved energy-efficiency and Quality-of-Service (QoS). However, BFLNs suffer with the challenges of exponential increased action space in deciding various parameter levels towards training and block generation. Motivated by aforementioned challenges of BFLNs, in this work, we are proposing an actor-critic Reinforcement Learning (RL) method to model the Machine Learning Model Owner (MLMO) in selecting the optimal set of parameter levels, addressing the challenges of exponential grow of action space in BFLNs. Further, due to the implicit entropy exploration, actor-critic RL method balances the exploration-exploitation trade-off and shows better performance than most off-policy methods, on large discrete action spaces. Therefore, in this work, considering the mobile scenario of the devices, MLMO decides the data and energy levels that the mobile devices use for the training and determine the block generation rate. This leads to minimized system latency and reduced overall cost, while achieving the target accuracy. Specifically, we have used Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) as an on-policy actor-critic method with it's two variants, one based on Monte Carlo (MC) returns and another based on Generalized Advantage Estimate (GAE). We analyzed that PPO has better exploration and sample efficiency, lesser training time, and consistently higher cumulative rewards, when compared to off-policy Deep Q-Network (DQN).},
