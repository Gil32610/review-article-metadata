AB As a huge number of heterogeneous smart things in the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm are connected to exchange services, security principles are needed to ensure safe communication in the network. From this perspective, various Trust Management models have been set forward in the literature in order to assess nodes trustworthiness and therefore to avoid malicious connections in the SIoT network. However, these models still lack practical solutions to address SIoT trust related attacks performed towards the trust evaluation process. In this regard, the present work stands for an in-depth study on the effectiveness of the trust attack management, as it is integrated into the trust model, with the aim of classifying the nodes behaviors more accurately in order to ensure secure connections in the network. For this reason, nodes behaviors analysis, based on Machine Learning (ML) algorithms, is carried out within our trust assessment process. Our objective lies in limiting interactions with not only poor service provider, but also with attacker nodes. The proposed trust method's acquired outcome reveals that our introduced TM model demonstrates an improved efficiency in identifying malicious nodes compared to a trust classification algorithm without nodes behaviors evaluation. Experimentation conducted within a simulated dataset based on real social data through Cooja; corroborates the efficiency of our proposed solution in terms of coping with simulated trust related attacks performed by malicious nodes.

TI Deep neural network for text anomaly detection in SIoT

DE Anomaly detection; Text mining; Social Internet of Things (SIoT)
AB Unsupervised textual anomaly detection, which discovers anomalies from unlabeled texts, is critical to improve the cybersecurity and interaction ability among the objects in the Social Internet of Things (SIoT). Recently, detecting anomalies by deep neural networks has become a popular trend. Specially, context vector data description (CVDD) method shows the promising performance. However, CVDD has two limitations: (1) it uses an one-class classification objective to constrain the sentence embeddings, which leads the learned embeddings to lose content information of text. (2) Scalar-based attention weights, which are used to extract sentence features, fail to focus on dimensional properties in a word. Learning the text contents and the dimensional properties is important for detection task in SIoT, which can help detector capture the difference between normal and anomaly texts. To overcome these limits, this paper proposes a textual anomaly detection network. First, an adversarial training strategy is designed to fight against the problem of missing content information. Second, a textual anomaly detection module with multiple dimensional transformation matrices is constructed to learn dimensional properties of words in diverse semantic subspaces. Experimental results on several textual datasets show that our proposed method outperforms CVDD and other strong baselines.

AB How to process and classify zero-day attacks due to their huge damage to social Internet of Things (SIoT) systems has become a hot research issue. To solve this issue, we propose a heuristic learning intrusion detection system with Deep Q-Networks (DQN) for edge-based SIoT networks under the scenario of insufficient training samples, which is named DQN-HIDS. It is composed of an SIoT network traffic processing module and a DQN-based heuristic learning network. The SIoT network traffic processing module generates SIoT traffic samples, selects samples entering a classifier and a cybersecurity examiner center, and outputs similarity. We integrate DQN into a heuristic learning network to gradually improve its ability to identify malicious traffic. Specially, reward functions are designed according to the selected actions of the network, in order to punish the behavior of incorrectly labeling malicious samples and make variable reward functions adapt to different execution actions. The LSTM-based DQN then maximizes the cumulative expected reward to find the optimal strategy for the heuristic learning network. Consequently, DQN-HIDS gradually improves the behavior frequency of its labeling, reduces resource workloads, and increases the ability to label SIoT network traffic. Experiments show the performance of DQN-HIDS in terms of the workload of the examiner center and the queue workload of delayed samples, the rewards obtained by the DQN-based heuristic learning network, and the accuracy of the classifier. Comparisons with a state-of-the-art deep learning model and typical machine learning methods are also made, demonstrating the advantages of DQN-HIDS with fewer SIoT network traffic samples.

AB Cybersecurity continues to be a serious issue for any sector in the cyberspace as the number of security breaches is increasing from time to time. It is known that thousands of zero-day attacks are continuously emerging because of the addition of various protocols mainly from Internet of Things (IoT). Most of these attacks are small variants of previously known cyber-attacks. This indicates that even advanced mechanisms such as traditional machine learning systems face difficulty of detecting these small mutants of attacks over time. On the other hand, the success of deep learning (DL) in various big data fields has drawn several interests in cybersecurity fields. The application of DL has been practical because of the improvement in CPU and neural network algorithms aspects. The use of DL for attack detection in the cyberspace could be a resilient mechanism to small mutations or novel attacks because of its high-level feature extraction capability. The self-taught and compression capabilities of deep learning architectures are key mechanisms for hidden pattern discovery from the training data so that attacks are discriminated from benign traffic. This research is aimed at adopting a new approach, deep learning, to cybersecurity to enable the detection of attacks in social internet of things. The performance of the deep model is compared against traditional machine learning approach, and distributed attack detection is evaluated against the centralized detection system. The experiments have shown that our distributed attack detection system is superior to centralized detection systems using deep learning model. It has also been demonstrated that the deep model is more effective in attack detection than its shallow counter parts. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Information diffusion in social Internet of Things (SIoT) brings convenience to life, but it also faces challenges. The explosive growth of information exceeds the computing capability of the network, making it difficult to control. Motivated by the challenge, a novel control strategy for information diffusion is proposed in SIoT, which is based on the advantages of edge computing with low latency, high energy efficiency and timely feedback. Furthermore, graph neural networks (GNNs) is combined with ordinary differential equation systems (ODEs) to model edge-aided control dynamics, describing high dimensionality and complicated interactions. Theoretical analysis and comparative simulation results show that the proposed edge-aided control strategy can dominate information diffusion within the target scope at the lowest cost.

DE Social internet of things; Natural language generation; Data-to-text
AB Social Internet of Things (SIoT) is an emerging paradigm connecting the Internet of things and social networks, enabling the social functions expanded into human-to-thing or interthing. There is an urgent issue of how to realize the social contact for communications between human and things or between things. This requires the natural language generation (NLG), focusing on generating text in human languages from non-linguistic data, which is of vital importance to achieve the interaction without barriers between human and other smart objects in SIoT. However, the existing solutions for data-to-text transformation rely on the specific template and standard neural networks models, which are not flexible when applying to the cross-domain data with diverse meaning. In this paper, we propose a novel model, called pipeline assisted neural networks (PAN), which integrates the traditional pipeline modules and neural generation systems, to conduct data-to-text generation tasks in SIoT. Our new PAN model makes use of attention module and gate mechanism to complete content selection, by analyzing records correlation and filtering redundant records. Then, a dedicated neural network is developed for salient span selection, pointing and transition to achieve content planning. In the end, we conduct experiments on the ROTOWIRE dataset to evaluate the performance of PAN. The results demonstrate that our proposed PAN model outperforms the existing solutions.

AB In Internet of things (IoT) and Social Internet of things (SIoT), how to select or recommend suitable smart objects from an ocean of smart objects has become an increasingly critical issue. In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model called BLA (BERT and Bi-LSTM with attention) for smart objects scoring tasks to make recommendations in social Internet of things. The model uses a BERT network to obtain the sentence vectors for a smart object related text, and then uses Bi-LSTM with two types of attention mechanisms to extract representations of the smart object vectors. The devised attention mechanism contains a self-attention (SA) layer and a global-attention (GA) layer. The SA layer is able to estimate the importance of sentences or fields, which in a certain sense can substitute for manually defined features at the sentence and field level. The GA layer can measure the relationships between sentences (or fields) and user requirements, which further helps the model obtain more effective smart object vectors. The thing-thing relationship of Internet of things is introduced into the model to inprove the recommendation effect. Experimental results on the datasets demonstrate that our model outperforms other baseline methods. (c) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

AB Nowadays, smart city paradigm plays a primary role in the fulfillment of sustainable solutions in the field of urban mobility, both public and private. At the same time, the Internet of Things (IoT) is allowing the development of increasingly advanced solutions for real-time management of collected information related to the management and coexistence of vehicles (i.e., buses, cars, trains, bicycles, etc.) immersed in urban and sub-urban traffic. The Social IoT (SIoT) paradigm adds a relational connotation between objects typical of human relationships. Objects operate as equals and request/provide information among them in the perspective of providing IoT services to users while maintaining their individuality. Social object relationship enables the design of solutions aiming to improve the exchange of information among network nodes in terms of security from malicious attacks external to the so-called social network of objects. In this context, a new SIoT smart city solution is presented in this article: private and public vehicles together with pedestrians are involved in a real-time collection of data to improve the viability of the city in order to suggest new directions and information to citizens to better organize how to live the city. The developed architecture presented in this article is equipped with an artificial intelligence that process collected traffic data and, thanks to machine learning techniques, evaluate the directions and flows undertaken by vehicles and pedestrians on a daily basis. The authors are also presenting an application that allow both citizens to live the city in a better way and municipal authorities to promptly manage traffic flows. The proposed system was installed in a specific area of Cagliari (Italy) and the traffic flows have been compared with daily traffic data monitored before the installation, observing an average gain of up to 35 percent in daily traffic reduction.

AB Energy consumption prediction has become an integral part of a smart and sustainable environment. With future demand forecasts, energy production and distribution can be optimized to meet the needs of the growing population. However, forecasting the demand of individual households is a challenging task due to the diversity of energy consumption patterns. Recently, it has become popular with artificial intelligence-based smart energy-saving designs, smart grid planning and social Internet of Things (IoT) based smart homes. Despite existing approaches for energy demand forecast, predominantly, such systems are based on one-step forecasting and have a short forecasting period. For resolving this issue and obtain high prediction accuracy, this study follows the prediction of household appliances' power in two phases. In the first phase, a long short-term memory (LSTM) based model is used to predict total generative active power for the coming 500 hours. The second phase employs a hybrid deep learning model that combines convolutional characteristics of neural network with LSTM for household electrical energy consumption forecasting of the week ahead utilizing Social IoT-based smart meter readings. Experimental results reveal that the proposed convolutional LSTM (ConvLSTM) architecture outperforms other models with the lowest root mean square error value of 367 kilowatts for weekly household power consumption.(c) 2022 Elsevier Inc.
