AB As the world becomes increasingly interconnected, emerging and innovative sensing technologies are shaping the future of agriculture, with a special focus on sustainability-related issues. In this context, we envision the possibility to exploit Social Internet of Things for sensing of environmental conditions (solar radiation, humidity, air temperature, and soil moisture) and communications, deep learning for plant disease detection, and crowdsourcing for images collection and classification, engaging farmers and community garden owners and experts. Through, data fusion and deep learning, the designed system can exploit the collected data and predict when a plant would (or not) get a disease, with a specific degree of precision, with the final purpose to render agriculture more sustainable. We here present the architecture, the deep learning model, and the responsive Web app. Finally, some experimental evaluations and usability/engagement tests are reported and discussed, together with final remarks, limitations, and future work.

AB Adopting Internet-of-things (IoT) in large-scale environments such as smart cities raises compatibility and trustworthiness challenges, hindering conventional service discovery and network navigability processes. The IoT network is known for its highly dynamic topology and frequently changing characteristics (e.g., the devices' status, such as battery capacity and computational power); traditional methods fail to learn and understand the evolving behavior of the network to enable real-time and context-aware service discovery in such diverse and large-scale topologies of IoT networks. The Social IoT (SIoT) concept, which defines the relationships among the connected objects, can be exploited to extract established relationships between devices and enable trustworthy and context-aware services. In fact, SIoT expresses the possible connections that devices can establish in the network and reflect compatibility, trustworthiness, and so on. In this paper, we investigate the service discovery process in SIoT networks by proposing a low-complexity context-aware Graph Neural Network (GNN) approach to enable rapid and dynamic service discovery. Unlike the conventional graph-based techniques, the proposed approach simultaneously embeds the devices' features and their SIoT relations. Our simulations on a real-world IoT dataset show that the proposed GNN-based approach can provide more concise clusters compared to traditional techniques, namely the Louvain and Leiden algorithms. This allows a better IoT network learning and understanding and also, speeds up the service lookup search space. Finally, we discuss implementing the GNN-assisted context-service discovery processes in novel smart city IoT-enabled applications.

AB With the increasing demand of users for personalized social services, social recommendation (SR) has been an important concern in academia. However, current research on SR universally faces two main challenges. On the one hand, SR lacks the considerable ability of robust online data management. On the other hand, SR fails to take the ambiguity of preference feedback into consideration. To bridge these gaps, a deep learning-embedded social Internet of Things (IoT) is proposed for ambiguity-aware SR (SIoT-SR). Specifically, a social IoT architecture is developed for social computing scenarios to guarantee reliable data management. A deep learning-based graph neural network model that can be embedded into the model is proposed as the core algorithm to perform ambiguity-aware SR. This design not only provides proper online data sensing and management but also overcomes the preference ambiguity problem in SR. To evaluate the performance of the proposed SIoT-SR, two real-world datasets are selected to establish experimental scenarios. The method is assessed using three different metrics, selecting five typical methods as benchmarks. The experimental results show that the proposed SIoT-SR performs better than the benchmark methods by at least 10% and has good robustness.

   Internet of Things (SIoT)
AB Nowadays, with the continuous development of information technology, the application scenarios of the Internet of Things (IoT) are progressively expanding to the social field, engendering widespread attention to the Social IoT (SIoT). Personalized fashion recommendation that possesses the potential to establish social relationships between clothing and humans has substantially broadened the scope of the SIoT, particularly with the flourishing fashion industry and the ascent of smart home. Compared to conventional recommendations, fashion recommendation generally suggests a collection of items rather than individual pieces for users. Additionally, considering the public acceptance alongside the user-specific preference is reasonable for fashion recommendation, however, current methods often overlook the former. To comprehensively capture the public acceptance and the user-specific preference, we propose a dual preference perception network (DP2Net) for fashion recommendation. First, a fashion corpus is constructed to facilitate the condensation of general taste, wherein adversarial learning and determinantal point process are leveraged to ensure representativeness and diversity of the corpus. Second, a user-general preference perception module is built based on a bottleneck transformer structure to generate aggregated representations for the corpus. Third, a user-specific preference perception module is constructed to acquire collaborative representations of users and outfits by employing an attentive heterogeneous graph embedding. The final loss functions of two preference perception modules are constructed by combining the representations of users, outfits, and the corpus. Experiments on large-scale real-world data sets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. To facilitate reproducible research, we have made our code publicly available at https://github.com/KaiZhang1228/DP2Net.

AB In the era of Internet of Things (IoT), intelligent recommendation is playing an important role in our daily life. How to provide personalized information to users is the core concern of Internet content service providers. To improve the recommendation quality, it is a hot topic to go beyond merely user-item interaction records and take social relations into account in IoT. Recently, emerged graph neural networks (GNNs) shine a light on simulating the recursive social diffusion process, to refine user embedding learning. Nevertheless, two key issues have not been well studied in previous studies: 1) they usually model user preference and social influence within a same semantic space and fail to simultaneously inject high-order connectivity information reflected in both user-item interaction graph and user-user social graph and 2) they typically rely on negative sampling to optimize a recommendation model, which makes them highly sensitive to the design of the sampler and hardly makes full use of GPU's computing ability. In light of this, we propose a novel framework for item recommendation, namely, an efficient adaptive graph convolutional network (EAGCN). Specifically, we introduce a space-adaptive graph convolutional module, which could jointly explore the propagation process of user interest and social influence. Furthermore, a user-specific gating mechanism is designed to aggregate user representations from both spaces. To make EAGCN practical in social IoT, we devise a fast nonsampling leaner to optimize EAGCN's parameters with better leveraging matrix computing of GPU. Extensive experiments under four scenarios show that our solution consistently and significantly outperforms strong baseline methods in both model effectiveness and training efficiency.

AB Social Internet of Things (SIoT) supports many novel applications and networking services for the IoT in a more powerful and productiveway. In this paper, we have introduced a hierarchical framework for feature extraction in SIoT big data using map-reduced framework along with a supervised classifier model. Moreover, a Gabor filter is used to reduce noise and unwanted data from the database, and Hadoop Map Reduce has been used for mapping and reducing big databases, to improve the efficiency of the proposed work. Furthermore, the feature selection has been performed on a filtered data set by using Elephant Herd Optimization. The proposed system architecture has been implemented using Linear Kernel Support Vector Machine-based classifier to classify the data and for predicting the efficiency of the proposed work. From the results, the maximum accuracy, specificity, and sensitivity of our work is 98.2%, 85.88%, and 80%, moreover analyzed time and memory, and these results have been compared with the existing literature.

AB The Social Internet of Things (SIoT) now penetrates our daily lives. As a strategy to alleviate the escalation of resource congestion, collaborative edge computing (CEC) has become a new paradigm for solving the needs of the Internet of Things (IoT). CEC can provide computing, storage, and network connection resources for remote devices. Because the edge network is closer to the connected devices, it involves a large amount of users' privacy. This also makes edge networks face more and more security issues, such as Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, unauthorized access, packet sniffing, and man-in-the-middle attacks. To combat these issues and enhance the security of edge networks, we propose a deep learning-based intrusion detection algorithm. Based on the generative adversarial network (GAN), we designed a powerful intrusion detection method. Our intrusion detection method includes three phases. First, we use the feature selection module to process the collaborative edge network traffic. Second, a deep learning architecture based on GAN is designed for intrusion detection aiming at a single attack. Finally, we propose a new intrusion detection model by combining several intrusion detection models that aim at a single attack. Intrusion detection aiming at multiple attacks is realized through the designed GAN-based deep learning architecture. Besides, we provide a comprehensive evaluation to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method.

   classification; Social Internet of Things (SIoT)
AB Text sentiment classification is of critical importance to improve the autonomous decision making and communication ability among object peers in the Social Internet of Things (SIoT). To classify sentiment polarity on a fine-grained level, aspect-level sentiment classification has become a promising direction in recent years. However, the existing solutions typically ignore the mutual information between sentences and their respective aspect terms while generally performing sentiment classification by using the simple attention mechanism. Thus, the relevant results seem to be unpromising. We aim to develop a novel neural-network-based model, by relying on the natural language processing model for rich feature extraction, called mutual attention neural networks (MANs), to conduct the aspect-level sentiment classification tasks in this article. Compared with the previous work, our proposed MAN model takes advantage of the bidirectional long short-term memory (Bi-LSTM) networks to obtain semantic dependence of sentences and their respective aspect terms, while learning the sentiment polarities of aspect terms in sentences by proposing the mutual attention mechanism. To evaluate the performance of MAN, we conduct our experiments on three real-world data sets, i.e., LAPTOP, REST, and TWITTER. The experimental results show that our proposed MAN model has significant performance improvements when compared to several existing models, in terms of aspect-level sentiment classification.

ID ALGORITHM
AB The Social Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm incorporates social networking concepts with the Internet of Things (IoT) solutions to support novel services. The massive amount of data (big data) produced by SIoT necessitates efficient information processing frameworks to exploit social relationships and comprehend actionable information from real-world observations. Data from AI-enabled sensors (AIS) is typically geo-tagged, thus demanding geo-textual processing for information retrieval and analysis. Social media applications are the main source of geo-textual data as mobile users connect with millions of posts daily. The processing of big geo-textual data requires resource-efficient algorithms and frameworks. Clustering algorithms are often applied to geo-textual data to examine spatial, textual, and temporal information for event detection, sentiment analysis, and search query response. Clustering algorithms on big data are resource-hungry requiring comparisons among all data points to calculate similarity and distance metrics. Existing hybrid clustering techniques execute algorithms collectively on geo-textual data resulting in a enormous footprint for big data. We propose a resource-efficient clustering framework for AIS that hierarchically performs geo-textual clustering without significantly lowering the clustering quality. The proposed framework achieves substantial time and memory efficiency while reducing the overall resource requirements for constrained end-user and edge devices compared to the standard hybrid geo-textual clustering framework. Moreover, we augment the research work by developing open-source scripts for both hierarchical and hybrid clustering frameworks.

AB Security is a critical element to the existing Internet of Things (IoT) deployment, where any user may actively or passively attack the content sharing of others reusing the same channel. As most smart devices are carried by human, we may leverage their owners' social trust to avoid being intercepted by untrusted users, which conforms to the Social Internet of Things (SIoT) paradigm. In this paper, we propose a secure content sharing (SCS) scheme to strike the trade-off between security and quality of experience (QoE) by exploring the social trust. Firstly, to dynamically extract the social trust, the random walk strategy is employed for prediction based on the proposed "User-Content-Social Group" graph which models users' preference over time. Given the social trust value, we propose a hierarchical game model to decouple the optimization problem into two sub-problems: user pairing and channel selection. More specifically, the user pairing sub-problem is formulated as a matching sub-game with peer effect, and the embedded rotation-swap matching algorithm can accommodate the dynamics caused by mutual interference. The second sub-problem can be formulated as a secure channel selection sub-game with the directed hypergraph being game space, which is proved to be an exact potential game. Then, we design an uncoupled-user concurrent learning algorithm (UUCL) to search for the optimal pure Nash equilibrium, and thereby the global optimum of this sub-game is achieved. Finally, simulation results generated on realistic social dataset verify that our proposed scheme can notably enhance the security without sacrificing users' QoE.

AB Device Classification (DC) is one of the critical network management means in the Internet of Things (IoT). Most machine learning-driven DC methods are implemented in two steps: firstly, extracting device features, and then training the classifier. Thus, for the same classifier, the quality of device features plays a decisive role. However, for one thing, these methods usually merely consider device traffic or device attributed features, ignoring the complex relationship between devices in Social IoT. For another thing, these features fed to the classifier are often selected manually without automatic learning. These two factors seriously affect the performance and flexibility of the algorithm. To address the above issues, we propose a novel Graph Contrastive Neural Network-based algorithm for DC dubbed GCNNDC. Specifically, based on the complex relationship between heterogeneous objects in Social IoT and the attribute information of the device itself, we first construct four kinds of homogeneous device-device attributed networks as the input of the neural network. Then, we train a novel GCNN model to learn informative device features in a self-supervised learning fashion. Finally, we leverage the features to train a classifier to complete the DC task. Experimental results on real-world IoT network dataset demonstrate the superiority of GCNNDC.

AB The integration of social networking concepts into the Internet of Things (IoT) has led to the so called Social Internet of Things paradigm, according to which the objects are capable of establishing social relationships in an autonomous way with respect to their owners. Within this scenario, "things" interact opportunistically with their peers to seek needed services. However, attacks and malfunctions in the IoT can outweigh any of its benefits if not handled adequately. In this article, we focus on the possible types of trust attacks that can affect the IoT and propose a trust management model able to overcome all the analyzed attacks. Simulations show how the proposed model can effectively isolate almost any malicious nodes in the network at the expense of an increase in the number of transactions needed for the model to converge.

AB The concept of "human as sensors" defines a new sensing model, in which humans act as sensors by contributing their observations, perceptions, and sensations. This is crucial for the development of Social Internet of Things, which is an integral part of cyber-physical-social systems. Online social media platforms, as the most active places where users act as social sensors, are responsive to real-world events and are useful for gathering situational information in real time. Unfortunately, posts rarely contain structured geographic information, thus hindering their usage for contributing to various challenges, such as emergency response. We address this limitation by introducing a general approach for extracting place names from tweets, named GazPNE2. It combines global gazetteers (i.e., OpenStreetMap and GeoNames), deep learning, and pretrained transformer models (i.e., BERT and BERTweet), which requires no manually annotated data. It can extract place names at both coarse (e.g., city) and fine-grained (e.g., street and POI) levels and place names with abbreviations. To fully evaluate GazPNE2 and compare it with 11 competing approaches, we use 19 public tweet data sets, containing 38 802 tweets and 22 197 places across the world. The results show GazPNE2 achieves a much higher F1 (0.8) than the other approaches. Furthermore, we apply GazPNE2 to three large unannotated tweet data sets related to over 20 crisis events (e.g., coronavirus disease 2019), containing 560 040 tweets. An F1 of 0.84 is achieved on 3000 tweets, which are randomly selected from the three data sets and then manually annotated. Code and data are available on GitHub page: https://github.com/uhuohuy/GazPNE2.
